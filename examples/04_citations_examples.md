## WHAT NEEDS A CITATION

### Claims That REQUIRE Citations

| Claim Type | Example | Why Citation Needed |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| Statistics | "College graduates earn $1,432 weekly" | Where does this number come from? |
| Research findings | "Studies show that earnings gap widens" | Which studies? |
| Specific data | "Unemployment is 2.2% for graduates" | Source for this percentage? |
| Expert opinions | "Economists argue that..." | Which economists? |
| Comparisons | "60% of jobs require degrees" | Who measured this? |
| Trends | "The gap has widened since 1980" | Based on what data? |

### Claims That DON'T Need Citations

| Claim Type | Example | Why No Citation |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Common knowledge | "High school ends around age 18" | Everyone knows this |
| Your own analysis | "This gap compounds over forty years" | You're doing the math |
| Logical conclusions | "Therefore, the investment pays off" | You're drawing a conclusion |
| General facts | "People work approximately 40 years" | Not contested |

## MLA IN-TEXT CITATION FORMATS

### Format 1: Parenthetical Citation (Most Common)

Place the author's last name OR organization name in parentheses at the END of the sentence, BEFORE the period.

**Structure:**
> "Factual claim goes here (Author)."

**Examples:**

**With Individual Author:**
> "College graduates earn approximately $1.2 million more over their lifetimes than those without degrees (Carnevale)."

**With Organization as Author:**
> "Workers with bachelor's degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432 (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

**With Shortened Organization Name:**
> "Unemployment rates for degree holders remain significantly lower during recessions (BLS)."

---

### Format 2: Signal Phrase (Integrated Citation)

Name the source IN your sentence. Parenthetical may or may not be needed.

**Structure:**
> "According to [Source], factual claim goes here."

**Examples:**

**Organization Named in Sentence:**
> "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432."

*No parenthetical needed—source is clearly identified.*

**Author Named in Sentence:**
> "Research by Anthony Carnevale at Georgetown University demonstrates that college graduates earn over $1 million more across their lifetimes."

*No parenthetical needed—author is named.*

**Partial Signal Phrase (Still Needs Parenthetical):**
> "Federal data shows that unemployment rates differ significantly by education level (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

*"Federal data" isn't specific enough—parenthetical clarifies.*

---

### Format 3: Direct Quote Citation

When using exact words from a source, add quotation marks AND cite.

**Structure:**
> "Source states that 'exact words from source' (Author)."

**Examples:**

**Short Quote:**
> "The report concludes that college graduates experience 'significantly lower unemployment rates during economic downturns' (Georgetown Center)."

**Quote with Signal Phrase:**
> "As the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, 'education pays in higher earnings and lower unemployment rates.'"

---

## WHAT TO DO: Distinguished-Level Citations

### Example 1: Multiple Citations in One Paragraph

> "College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics). This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income. Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only high school diplomas (Carnevale). Research from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce confirms that graduates typically recover their educational investment within a decade (Carnevale)."

**Citations present:**
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (for weekly salary comparison)
- Carnevale (for lifetime earnings figure)
- Carnevale (for investment recovery timeline)

**Why this is Distinguished:**
- EVERY factual claim is cited
- All citations are properly MLA formatted
- Multiple sources strengthen credibility
- Citations support the thesis

---

### Example 2: Variety of Citation Formats

> "The unemployment rate for college graduates stands at 2.2%, while high school graduates face nearly double that rate at 4.0% (Bureau of Labor Statistics). According to Federal Reserve research, this gap widens dramatically during economic recessions, when employers preferentially retain credentialed workers (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). As economist Anthony Carnevale notes, 'The college earnings premium has remained remarkably stable over decades, even as the economy has transformed' (Carnevale)."

**Formats used:**
- Parenthetical (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
- Signal phrase + parenthetical (Federal Reserve)
- Signal phrase with quote (Carnevale)

**Why this is Distinguished:**
- Every claim has a citation
- Varied citation formats show sophistication
- All properly formatted
- All support the argument

---

### Example 3: Handling Multiple Sources

> "Multiple government agencies confirm the financial benefits of higher education. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports weekly earnings differences of nearly 70% between degree holders and high school graduates (Bureau of Labor Statistics). Federal Reserve data corroborates this finding, showing that the earnings gap emerges by age 34 and continues widening through retirement (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). Independent research from Georgetown University further supports these findings, calculating the lifetime difference at over $1.2 million (Carnevale)."

**Why this is Distinguished:**
- Three different authoritative sources
- Each claim properly attributed
- Sources reinforce each other
- Shows thorough research

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO: Citation Errors

### Mistake 1: Uncited Statistics

**Bad Example:**
> "College graduates earn $1.2 million more over their lifetimes. The unemployment rate is 2.2% for graduates and 4.0% for high school graduates only."

*Why it fails:*
- Two specific statistics with no sources
- Reader has no way to verify
- Could be made up
- Loses significant citation points

**How to Fix:**
> "College graduates earn $1.2 million more over their lifetimes (Carnevale). The unemployment rate is 2.2% for graduates and 4.0% for high school graduates (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

---

### Mistake 2: Citation in Wrong Position

**Bad Example A (Citation After Period):**
> "College graduates earn more money. (Bureau of Labor Statistics)"

*Why it fails:*
- Citation should be BEFORE the period
- Appears disconnected from the sentence
- Incorrect MLA format

**Bad Example B (Citation Floating):**
> "According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics), earnings differ."

*Why it fails:*
- Redundant—source is already named
- Use signal phrase OR parenthetical, not both

**How to Fix:**
> "College graduates earn more money (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

OR

> "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, college graduates earn more money."

---

### Mistake 3: Vague Source References

**Bad Example A:**
> "Studies show that college graduates earn more."

*Why it fails:*
- "Studies" is not a citation
- Which studies? By whom? When?
- Sounds like you're making it up

**Bad Example B:**
> "Research indicates that the earnings gap is significant."

*Why it fails:*
- "Research" is vague
- No specific source named
- Not verifiable

**Bad Example C:**
> "Experts agree that college is worth it."

*Why it fails:*
- "Experts" is unnamed
- Which experts? What are their credentials?
- Not a proper citation

**How to Fix:**
> "Research from Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce demonstrates that college graduates earn over $1 million more across their lifetimes (Carnevale)."

---

### Mistake 4: Misplaced Quotation Marks

**Bad Example A (Missing Quotes on Direct Quote):**
> "The report says college graduates earn 66% more over their lifetimes (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

*Why it fails:*
- If these are exact words, they need quotation marks
- If paraphrased, clarify that
- Plagiarism concern

**Bad Example B (Quote Without Citation):**
> "College graduates experience 'significantly lower unemployment rates during economic downturns.'"

*Why it fails:*
- Quote marks indicate exact words
- But no citation tells us WHO said this
- Must attribute the quote

**How to Fix (Direct Quote):**
> "The report states that 'college graduates earn 66% more over their lifetimes' (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

**How to Fix (Paraphrase):**
> "The report indicates that college graduates earn approximately two-thirds more than high school graduates over their lifetimes (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

---

### Mistake 5: Citation Doesn't Support Claim

**Bad Example:**
> "College graduates have better social skills (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

*Why it fails:*
- BLS doesn't measure social skills
- Citation exists but doesn't support this claim
- Using wrong source for claim type
- Counts as incorrect in rubric

**How to Fix:**
Either find a source that actually discusses social skills, or remove the claim if no source exists.

---

### Mistake 6: Same Citation for Everything

**Bad Example:**
> "College graduates earn more (Carnevale). They also have lower unemployment (Carnevale). They can change careers more easily (Carnevale). Trade workers face physical strain (Carnevale)."

*Why it fails:*
- One source probably doesn't cover all these topics
- Looks like you didn't research properly
- Some claims likely unsupported by this source

**How to Fix:**
Use appropriate sources for each type of claim:
- Earnings: Carnevale (Georgetown)
- Unemployment: Bureau of Labor Statistics
- Career changes: Federal Reserve data
- Physical strain: BLS occupational health data

---

## DIRECT QUOTES VS. PARAPHRASES

### When to Use Direct Quotes (Sparingly—1-2 per essay)

Use direct quotes when:
- The original wording is particularly powerful
- You're citing a specific definition
- The exact phrasing matters
- An authority's words carry special weight

**Example:**
> "The Bureau of Labor Statistics bluntly states that 'education pays in higher earnings and lower unemployment rates' (BLS)."

---

### When to Paraphrase (Most of the Time)

Paraphrase when:
- You're presenting data or statistics
- You want to show you understand the source
- The original wording isn't special
- You need to integrate information smoothly

**Example:**

*Original:* "Workers with bachelor's degrees earn 66% more than those with only high school diplomas."

*Paraphrase:* "According to federal data, degree holders earn approximately two-thirds more than workers without college education (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

---

### Paraphrasing Rules

**DO:**
- Completely reword the original
- Keep the meaning accurate
- Still cite the source
- Show you understand the content

**DON'T:**
- Just swap synonyms
- Keep the original sentence structure
- Forget to cite (paraphrases still need citations!)
- Change the meaning

---

## HOW MANY CITATIONS DO YOU NEED?

### Minimum for Distinguished (15/15)
"Every claim" = roughly:
- 1-2 citations in Body ¶1
- 1-2 citations in Body ¶2
- 1-2 citations in Body ¶3
- **Total: 4-6 citations minimum**

### Recommended
- 2 citations per body paragraph
- Use 2-3 different sources across essay
- Variety of citation formats (some parenthetical, some signal phrase)

### What Counts as a "Claim"
Every time you state something that could be questioned with "How do you know that?"—you need a citation.

2. **Format Test:** Are all my citations in proper MLA format (Author) or (Organization)?

3. **Position Test:** Are all parenthetical citations BEFORE the period?

4. **Variety Test:** Am I using multiple sources, not just one?

5. **Support Test:** Does each citation actually support the claim it follows?

6. **Quote Test:** Are direct quotes in quotation marks AND cited?

7. **Signal Test:** When I name a source in my sentence, is it clear enough that I don't need a redundant parenthetical?
