## INTRODUCTION MISTAKES (15 Points at Risk)

### Mistake #1: The Boring Hook

**What students do:**
> "Many people go to college after high school."

**Why it costs points:**
- "Many people" is vague
- No specific information
- Doesn't capture interest
- Rubric requires "engaging hook capturing reader interest"

**Point cost:** 3 points (drops from 15 to 12)

**How to fix:**
> "Every May, approximately 3.7 million American high school seniors face a decision that will fundamentally shape their financial futures."

---

### Mistake #2: The Announcement Opening

**What students do:**
> "In this essay, I will discuss whether college is worth the investment."

**Why it costs points:**
- First person ("I will")
- Announces instead of hooks
- Meta-commentary about the essay itself
- Not engaging

**Point cost:** 3-6 points

**How to fix:**
> "The question of whether college is worth the investment has a clear answer: for most students, the data overwhelmingly favors higher education."

---

### Mistake #3: Only 3 Sentences

**What students do:**
Write exactly 3 sentences for the introduction.

**Why it costs points:**
- Rubric requires "exceeds 3 sentences"
- Exceeds = more than = at least 4
- 3 sentences = Basic level (9 points)

**Point cost:** 6 points (drops from 15 to 9)

**How to fix:**
Write 4-6 sentences. Count them.

---

### Mistake #4: The Wishy-Washy Thesis

**What students do:**
> "College is a good option that students might want to consider."

**Why it costs points:**
- "Good option" is weak
- "Might want to consider" is non-committal
- No clear position
- No preview of reasons

**Point cost:** 3-6 points

**How to fix:**
> "College remains the best choice for most high school graduates because it provides higher earnings, greater flexibility, and stronger job security than alternatives."

---

### Mistake #5: Missing Thesis Completely

**What students do:**
Write hook and context but never state their position.

**Why it costs points:**
- Rubric requires "thesis statement that provides a clear position"
- Without thesis, reader doesn't know your argument
- Essay has no direction

**Point cost:** 6-9 points

**How to fix:**
End your introduction with a clear thesis that states your position and previews your three reasons.

---

## BODY PARAGRAPH MISTAKES (15 Points at Risk)

### Mistake #6: Only Two Body Paragraphs

**What students do:**
Write introduction, two body paragraphs, and conclusion.

**Why it costs points:**
- Distinguished requires "three paragraphs or more"
- Two paragraphs = Proficient (12 points max)
- Missing third of your argument

**Point cost:** 3 points (automatic cap at 12)

**How to fix:**
Write THREE body paragraphs. Plan them before you write.

---

### Mistake #7: Multiple Claims in One Paragraph

**What students do:**
> "College provides higher earnings, more career options, better networking, and personal growth."

Then try to address all four in one paragraph.

**Why it costs points:**
- Rubric requires "one claim per paragraph"
- Can't fully develop multiple claims
- Paragraph becomes superficial

**Point cost:** 3-6 points

**How to fix:**
Choose ONE claim per paragraph. Save others for other paragraphs or cut them.

---

### Mistake #8: General Examples (Not Detailed)

**What students do:**
> "Studies show that college graduates earn more money."

**Why it costs points:**
- "Studies show" is vague
- No specific data
- No source named
- Distinguished requires "detailed examples"

**Point cost:** 3-6 points

**How to fix:**
> "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, college graduates earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for high school graduates (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

---

### Mistake #9: Evidence Without Explanation

**What students do:**
> "College graduates earn $30,000 more per year (BLS). Career flexibility is also important."

**Why it costs points:**
- Drops evidence without explaining significance
- Immediately jumps to new topic
- Not "fully developed"

**Point cost:** 3 points

**How to fix:**
> "College graduates earn $30,000 more per year (BLS). This difference compounds over a forty-year career to create more than one million dollars in additional lifetime wealth—enough to fund retirement, purchase property, and achieve financial security."

---

### Mistake #10: No Transitions Between Paragraphs

**What students do:**
End Body ¶1 with a link to thesis.
Start Body ¶2 with "Career flexibility is important."

**Why it costs points:**
- Abrupt topic change
- No connection to previous paragraph
- Hurts organization score too

**Point cost:** 3 points

**How to fix:**
> "Beyond these compelling financial advantages, college also provides career flexibility that becomes increasingly valuable in a changing economy."

---

## ORGANIZATION MISTAKES (15 Points at Risk)

### Mistake #11: Random Paragraph Order

**What students do:**
- Body ¶1: Career flexibility
- Body ¶2: Campus social life
- Body ¶3: Earnings data

**Why it costs points:**
- No logical progression
- Strongest argument (earnings) buried
- Topics don't build on each other

**Point cost:** 3-6 points

**How to fix:**
Order intentionally:
- Body ¶1: Strongest/most concrete (earnings)
- Body ¶2: Builds on first (flexibility)
- Body ¶3: Counterargument/rebuttal

---

### Mistake #12: Weak Single-Word Transitions

**What students do:**
> "Also, another benefit is..."
> "Additionally, students gain..."
> "Furthermore, college provides..."

**Why it costs points:**
- Not "strong, explicit transitions"
- Feels like a checklist
- No actual connection between ideas

**Point cost:** 3 points

**How to fix:**
> "Beyond these financial advantages, college equips graduates with flexibility that proves invaluable as industries evolve."

---

### Mistake #13: Conclusion Introduces New Arguments

**What students do:**
> "In conclusion, college is worth it. Also, the social connections made at college are valuable for networking."

(When networking was never discussed in body)

**Why it costs points:**
- New information belongs in body
- Disrupts "clear end"
- Shows disorganization

**Point cost:** 3-6 points (affects both Organization and Conclusion)

**How to fix:**
Either add a body paragraph about networking, OR remove it from conclusion entirely.

---

## IN-TEXT CITATION MISTAKES (15 Points at Risk)

### Mistake #14: Uncited Statistics

**What students do:**

---

## CONCLUSION MISTAKES (15 Points at Risk)

### Mistake #19: Copying Introduction Thesis

---

### Mistake #21: Undermining Your Argument

**Why it costs points:**
- "Just my opinion" undermines evidence-based argument
