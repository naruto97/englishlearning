## THE TEEL STRUCTURE (Required Framework)

Every body paragraph should follow TEEL:

| Letter | Component | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **T** | Topic Sentence | States ONE claim, connects to thesis |
| **E** | Evidence | Specific data, statistics, quotes WITH citation |
| **E** | Explanation | Analyzes WHY the evidence supports your claim |
| **L** | Link | Connects back to thesis OR transitions to next paragraph |

---

## COMPONENT 1: TOPIC SENTENCES (ONE CLAIM)

### What Makes a Good Topic Sentence

A good topic sentence:
- States ONE specific claim
- Connects to the thesis promise
- Is provable with evidence
- Tells reader what this paragraph will prove

---

### WHAT TO DO: Distinguished-Level Topic Sentences

**Example A (Body ¶1 - Earnings):**
> "College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school."

*Why it works:*
- ONE clear claim (earnings advantage)
- Connects to thesis preview
- Provable with data
- Reader knows exactly what paragraph will prove

**Example B (Body ¶2 - Flexibility):**
> "Beyond financial benefits, college education provides unmatched career flexibility that becomes increasingly valuable in a rapidly changing economy."

*Why it works:*
- Transitions from previous point ("Beyond financial benefits")
- ONE new claim (career flexibility)
- Connects to larger economic context
- Sets up new argument

**Example C (Body ¶3 - Counterargument):**
> "While proponents of trade schools and immediate employment raise valid points, these advantages diminish significantly when examined over a full career span."

*Why it works:*
- Acknowledges opposing view fairly
- ONE claim (advantages diminish over time)
- Sets up rebuttal structure
- Shows sophisticated argumentation

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Weak Topic Sentences

#### Mistake 1: Multiple Claims in One Sentence

**Bad Example:**
> "College leads to higher earnings, better job security, more career options, and greater personal fulfillment."

*Why it fails:*
- Four claims crammed into one sentence
- Impossible to fully develop all four
- Each deserves its own paragraph
- Violates "one claim per paragraph" rule

**How to Fix:**
Pick ONE claim for this paragraph. Save others for other paragraphs.
> "College graduates enjoy substantially higher earnings throughout their careers, a financial advantage that compounds over decades."

---

#### Mistake 2: The Vague Topic Sentence

**Bad Example:**
> "There are many reasons why college is a good choice."

*Why it fails:*
- Doesn't state a specific claim
- "Many reasons" is vague
- "Good choice" is weak language
- Reader doesn't know what's coming

**How to Fix:**
> "College proves to be a wise choice primarily because of the significant lifetime earnings advantage it provides over alternative paths."

---

#### Mistake 3: Evidence Without Claim

**Bad Example:**
> "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, college graduates earn $1,432 weekly."

*Why it fails:*
- Leads with evidence, not claim
- No interpretation of what this means
- Data point without argument
- Evidence should SUPPORT claim, not BE the claim

**How to Fix:**
> "College graduates earn substantially more than their non-degreed peers, a difference that represents over a million dollars across a typical career."

Then use the statistic as evidence within the paragraph.

---

#### Mistake 4: No Connection to Thesis

**Bad Example:**
> "College campuses offer many social activities for students."

*Why it fails:*
- Doesn't connect to thesis about financial/career benefits
- Random tangent
- Reader wonders why this is relevant
- Doesn't support the argument

**How to Fix:**
Either cut this topic entirely, or connect it to the argument:
> "Beyond academics, college environments foster networking relationships that often translate into career opportunities and higher lifetime earnings."

---

## COMPONENT 2: EVIDENCE (Specific and Cited)

### What Makes Evidence "Detailed" vs. "General"

**DETAILED** = Specific numbers, named sources, concrete data
**GENERAL** = Vague references, unsupported claims, no specifics

---

### WHAT TO DO: Distinguished-Level Evidence

**Example A (Specific Statistics):**
> "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

*Why it works:*
- Specific dollar amounts ($1,432 vs. $853)
- Named authoritative source
- Proper MLA citation
- Directly supports earnings claim

**Example B (Percentage Comparison):**
> "The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that workers with bachelor's degrees have access to over 60% of job postings in the current market, compared to only 34% for those with high school diplomas alone (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

*Why it works:*
- Concrete percentages
- Clear comparison
- Relevant to career flexibility claim
- Properly cited

**Example C (Research Finding):**
> "Research from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce shows that graduates typically recover their educational investment within a decade, after which the earnings advantage continues accumulating for the remaining three decades of their careers (Carnevale)."

*Why it works:*
- Names specific research institution
- Provides timeline (decade to recover)
- Addresses the cost objection
- Proper citation

**Example D (Multiple Data Points):**
> "Federal Reserve data reveals that by age 34, college graduates' earnings surpass those of trade workers, and this gap widens continuously through retirement—reaching a lifetime difference of over $1.2 million (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)."

*Why it works:*
- Specific age reference
- Trajectory described
- Cumulative figure provided
- Authoritative source

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Weak Evidence

#### Mistake 1: Vague Claims Without Data

**Bad Example:**
> "Studies show that college graduates make more money."

*Why it fails:*
- "Studies" is vague—which studies?
- "More money" is unquantified
- No citation
- Not detailed, just general

**How to Fix:**
> "Research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics demonstrates that college graduates earn, on average, $30,000 more annually than high school graduates, a gap that has persisted for decades (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

---

#### Mistake 2: Personal Opinion as Evidence

**Bad Example:**
> "Everyone knows that college is worth it in the long run."

*Why it fails:*
- "Everyone knows" isn't evidence
- Appeals to common knowledge
- No data, no source
- Unverifiable claim

**How to Fix:**
> "According to a 2023 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 86% of college graduates report that their education was worth the cost, citing increased earnings and career satisfaction (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)."

---

#### Mistake 3: Uncited Statistics

**Bad Example:**
> "College graduates earn $1.2 million more over their lifetimes."

*Why it fails:*
- Number is presented but not cited
- Reader doesn't know where this comes from
- Could be made up for all they know
- Loses citation points

**How to Fix:**
> "According to Georgetown University research, college graduates earn approximately $1.2 million more over their lifetimes than workers with only high school diplomas (Carnevale)."

---

#### Mistake 4: Outdated or Irrelevant Evidence

**Bad Example:**
> "A 1985 study found that college graduates earned more than high school graduates."

*Why it fails:*
- 40-year-old data isn't current
- Economy has changed dramatically
- Raises questions about whether this is still true
- Use sources from the last 5-7 years

**How to Fix:**
> "Current data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2023) confirms that college graduates continue to out-earn high school graduates by approximately 67% (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

---

## COMPONENT 3: EXPLANATION (Analysis)

### What Makes Explanation "Fully Developed"

**FULLY DEVELOPED** = Explains WHY evidence matters, does analysis, connects to claim
**UNDERDEVELOPED** = Drops evidence without explaining it

---

### WHAT TO DO: Distinguished-Level Explanation

**Example A (Mathematical Analysis):**
> "This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 annually. Over a forty-year career, this difference compounds to approximately $1.2 million in additional lifetime earnings for degree holders. Even accounting for four years of tuition costs and foregone income during college, graduates typically recover their investment within ten years and continue accumulating wealth advantages for the remaining three decades of their careers."

*Why it works:*
- Does the math for the reader
- Shows cumulative effect
- Addresses potential objection (tuition costs)
- Explains significance, doesn't just repeat evidence

**Example B (Implication Analysis):**
> "This broader access matters because career paths rarely unfold as planned; the average American changes careers—not just jobs—five to seven times during their working life. A college degree serves as a universal credential that opens doors across industries, while trade certifications, though valuable, typically qualify workers only for positions within their specific trade."

*Why it works:*
- Explains WHY the statistic matters
- Provides additional context
- Compares to alternative path
- Shows sophisticated thinking

**Example C (Long-term Perspective):**
> "These long-term realities—earnings crossover, physical toll, and career ceiling—reveal that the short-term advantages of skipping college come at the cost of long-term financial security and physical wellbeing."

*Why it works:*
- Synthesizes multiple points
- Uses parallel structure
- Connects to larger argument
- Provides interpretation, not just data

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Weak Explanation

#### Mistake 1: Just Repeating Evidence

**Bad Example:**
> "As shown, college graduates earn $1,432 weekly while high school graduates earn $853. This means college graduates earn more."

*Why it fails:*
- Just restates the numbers
- "This means they earn more" is obvious
- No analysis or insight
- Doesn't explain WHY this matters

**How to Fix:**
> "This $579 weekly difference may seem modest, but over a forty-year career, it compounds to over $1.2 million in additional lifetime earnings—enough to fund retirement, purchase property, and provide security that workers without degrees rarely achieve."

---

#### Mistake 2: Moving On Too Quickly

**Bad Example:**
> "College graduates earn more (Bureau of Labor Statistics). They also have more job options."

*Why it fails:*
- Drops evidence without explanation
- Immediately jumps to new point
- Doesn't develop the first claim
- Paragraph will feel rushed and thin

**How to Fix:**
Fully explain ONE piece of evidence before introducing another:
> "This earnings advantage (Bureau of Labor Statistics) has profound implications for quality of life. The additional $30,000 per year enables college graduates to build savings, purchase homes earlier, and weather financial emergencies more easily. Over time, these advantages compound, creating a widening gap in net worth and financial security between degree holders and those without."

---

#### Mistake 3: Vague Interpretation

**Bad Example:**
> "This shows that college is good for your career."

*Why it fails:*
- "Good" is vague
- Doesn't explain HOW or WHY
- No depth of analysis
- Misses opportunity to develop argument

**How to Fix:**
> "This data demonstrates that college does not merely provide a temporary boost but rather establishes a permanently higher earning trajectory that benefits graduates throughout their entire careers."

---

## COMPONENT 4: LINK (Transition and Connection)

### Types of Links

**Link to Thesis:** Connects paragraph's argument back to your main claim
**Link to Next Paragraph:** Transitions smoothly to the next argument

---

### WHAT TO DO: Distinguished-Level Links

**Example A (Link to Thesis):**
> "This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that despite initial costs, college education delivers a powerful return on investment that direct workforce entry cannot match."

*Why it works:*
- Refers back to thesis concept
- Reinforces paragraph's claim
- Strong, conclusive language

**Example B (Transition to Next Paragraph):**
> "While these financial benefits are substantial, the advantages of college extend beyond the paycheck into career flexibility and professional mobility."

*Why it works:*
- Acknowledges current paragraph's point
- Signals what's coming next
- Creates smooth flow
- Uses transition word ("While")

**Example C (Combined):**
> "This flexibility provides not merely convenience but essential insurance against industry disruption, automation, and the unpredictable evolution of the job market—further supporting the case for higher education."

*Why it works:*
- Broadens the significance
- Connects to larger themes
- Ties back to thesis argument

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Weak Links

#### Mistake 1: Abrupt Ending

**Bad Example:**
Last sentence of paragraph: "College graduates earn $1.2 million more."

Then new paragraph starts without transition.

*Why it fails:*
- No link back to thesis
- No transition to next topic
- Paragraph feels chopped off
- Hurts organization score too

**How to Fix:**
End with a linking sentence:
> "This substantial lifetime earnings advantage demonstrates that the investment in college, while significant upfront, pays dividends for decades—making it the financially superior choice."

---

#### Mistake 2: Weak Transition Words Only

**Bad Example:**
> "In addition, another reason is career flexibility."

*Why it fails:*
- "In addition" alone isn't enough
- "Another reason" is mechanical
- Doesn't connect the ideas
- Feels like a checklist

**How to Fix:**
> "Beyond these compelling financial advantages, college provides a second crucial benefit: the career flexibility necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving economy."

## COMPLETE BODY PARAGRAPH EXAMPLES

### BODY PARAGRAPH 1: Financial Argument (Distinguished Level)

> "College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school. [TOPIC SENTENCE - one claim] According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [EVIDENCE - specific, cited] This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income, a difference that compounds dramatically over a career. [EXPLANATION - does the math] Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only high school diplomas, even after accounting for the cost of tuition and the four years of foregone income (Carnevale). [ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE - addresses objection] Research from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce confirms that graduates typically recover their educational investment within a decade, after which the earnings advantage continues accumulating for the remaining thirty years of their careers (Carnevale). [EXPLANATION - timeline] This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that despite initial costs, college education delivers a return on investment that direct workforce entry cannot match. [LINK - connects to thesis]"

**Sentence count:** 6 ✓
**One claim:** ✓ (earnings advantage)
**Detailed evidence:** ✓ (specific dollars, percentages, sources)
**Fully developed:** ✓ (math explained, objection addressed)
**Link:** ✓ (connects to thesis)

### BODY PARAGRAPH 2: Career Flexibility (Distinguished Level)

> "Beyond financial benefits, college education provides unmatched career flexibility that becomes increasingly valuable in a rapidly changing economy. [TOPIC SENTENCE with transition] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that workers with bachelor's degrees have access to over 60% of job postings in the current market, compared to only 34% for those with high school diplomas alone (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [EVIDENCE - specific percentages] This broader access matters because career paths rarely unfold as planned; the average American changes careers—not just jobs—five to seven times during their working life. [EXPLANATION - why it matters] A college degree serves as a universal credential that opens doors across industries, while trade certifications, though valuable, typically qualify workers only for positions within their specific trade. [EXPLANATION - comparison] For example, an electrician seeking to transition into project management, sales, or business ownership may find doors closed without additional credentials, whereas a college graduate can pivot between fields more readily. [DETAILED EXAMPLE] This flexibility provides not merely convenience but essential insurance against industry disruption, automation, and the unpredictable evolution of the job market. [LINK - connects to larger significance]"

**Sentence count:** 6 ✓
**One claim:** ✓ (career flexibility)
**Transition:** ✓ ("Beyond financial benefits")
**Detailed evidence:** ✓ (percentages, career change statistics)
**Fully developed:** ✓ (comparison, example, explanation)

### BODY PARAGRAPH 3: Counterargument/Rebuttal (Distinguished Level)

> "While proponents of trade schools and immediate employment raise valid points—including the ability to earn income immediately, avoid student debt, and learn practical skills—these advantages diminish significantly when examined over a full career span. [TOPIC SENTENCE - acknowledges, then rebuts] Trade school graduates do typically begin earning sooner, and many trades offer starting salaries that exceed entry-level positions available to new college graduates. [FAIR PRESENTATION of opposition's point] However, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that by age 34, college graduates' earnings surpass those of trade workers, and this gap widens continuously through retirement (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). [REBUTTAL with evidence] Additionally, trade work often involves physical demands that become increasingly difficult to sustain; Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that workers in physically demanding occupations report higher rates of chronic injury and earlier workforce exit than their office-based counterparts (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [ADDITIONAL evidence] These long-term realities—earnings crossover, physical toll, and career ceiling—reveal that the short-term advantages of skipping college come at the cost of long-term financial security and physical wellbeing. [LINK - synthesizes and connects to thesis]"

**Sentence count:** 5 ✓
**One claim:** ✓ (short-term advantages don't outweigh long-term costs)
**Addresses counterargument:** ✓ (fairly, then rebuts)
**Detailed evidence:** ✓ (age 34 crossover, injury data)
**Link:** ✓ (back to thesis)

### PROFICIENT LEVEL (12/15) - Example

> "College graduates earn more money than people who don't go to college. [TOPIC SENTENCE - but weak wording] Studies show that people with degrees make about $30,000 more per year than high school graduates. [EVIDENCE - general, uncited] This is a significant difference that adds up over time. [EXPLANATION - basic] Over a career, this means college graduates will have more money for retirement and other expenses. [EXPLANATION - somewhat developed] College is a good investment for the future. [LINK - weak, vague]"

*Why this is 12/15, not 15/15:*
- Has detailed examples but lacks citation
- "Studies show" is vague—which studies?
- Explanation is adequate but not fully developed
- Link is weak ("good investment" is vague)
- Only 5 sentences (acceptable, but could be stronger)

---

### BASIC LEVEL (9/15) - Example

> "College helps you make more money. People who go to college earn more than people who don't. This is important because money helps you live a good life. College is worth the investment."

*Why this is 9/15:*
- ONE paragraph (not three)
- General examples (no specific data)
- Lacks detailed specifics
- No citations
- Vague language throughout

---

### BELOW EXPECTATIONS (6/15) - Example

> "College is good for jobs. It can help you get hired. Some people don't go to college and they still get jobs, which is also fine."

*Why this is 6/15:*
- Only one paragraph
- Claim relevance is unclear
- No examples or evidence
- Last sentence undermines the thesis
- Confusing argument

---

### NON-PERFORMANCE (3/15) - Example

> "College is important. Jobs need degrees."

*Why this is 3/15:*
- Only 2 sentences
- No detailed claim
- No examples
- No development whatsoever

## TRANSITIONS BETWEEN BODY PARAGRAPHS

### WHAT TO DO: Effective Transitions

**Between Body ¶1 and Body ¶2:**
> "Beyond financial benefits, college provides career flexibility that proves invaluable as industries evolve and job markets shift."

> "While higher earnings form the foundation of college's value, the flexibility it provides may prove even more crucial in an unpredictable economy."

> "Financial advantages alone, however, do not tell the complete story."

**Between Body ¶2 and Body ¶3:**
> "Despite these substantial advantages, critics of college education raise important objections that deserve serious consideration."

> "While these benefits are compelling, advocates for alternative paths present arguments worth examining."

> "These advantages, however, do not go uncontested; proponents of trade schools and immediate employment offer counterarguments worth addressing."

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Weak Transitions

**Bad Example A:**
> "Another point is..."

*Why it fails:* Mechanical, doesn't connect ideas

**Bad Example B:**
> "Next, I will discuss..."

*Why it fails:* Meta-commentary, announces instead of transitions

**Bad Example C:**
> New paragraph with no transition at all—just starts new topic

*Why it fails:* Abrupt, hurts organization score

---
