- "Fundamentally shape" emphasizes stakes
- Captures reader interest immediately
- NOT vague like "Many people face decisions"

- [ESTABLISHES WHY THIS MATTERS] ✓
- Connects to multiple outcomes (earnings, unemployment, advancement)
- "Research consistently shows" signals evidence-based argument
- Colon creates emphasis on what follows

### BODY PARAGRAPH 1: Financial Argument (Part of 15/15)

```
The most compelling evidence for college's value lies in its financial
returns, which substantially exceed those of any alternative path.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 1 (Topic Sentence):**
- [ONE CLEAR CLAIM] ✓ (financial returns)
- [CONNECTS TO THESIS] ✓ ("superior lifetime earnings" → "financial returns")
- [TRANSITION FROM INTRO] ✓ ("most compelling evidence")
- Strong, direct claim that can be proven with evidence

---

```
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's
degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for
those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 2 (Evidence):**
- [SPECIFIC DATA] ✓ ($1,432 vs $853)
- [AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE] ✓ (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
- [PROPER MLA CITATION] ✓ (parenthetical format)
- Signal phrase + parenthetical is acceptable here
- Comparison makes the gap concrete

---

```
This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in
additional annual income, a difference that compounds dramatically
over a career.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 3 (Explanation):**
- [DOES THE MATH] ✓ ($600/week → $30,000/year)
- Shows reader the significance
- "Compounds dramatically" previews long-term impact
- Doesn't just repeat the evidence—analyzes it

---

```
Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn
approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only
high school diplomas (Carnevale).

- [SECOND SOURCE] ✓ (Carnevale/Georgetown)
- [PROPER CITATION] ✓

within a decade, after which the earnings advantage continues
accumulating for the remaining thirty years of their careers (Carnevale).
```

- [ADDRESSES OBJECTION] ✓ (acknowledges there IS an investment to recover)
- [PROVIDES TIMELINE] ✓ (decade to recover, thirty years of benefit)
- [PROPER CITATION] ✓
- Sophisticated argument that anticipates reader concern about costs

---

```
This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that
despite initial costs, college education delivers a return on investment
that direct workforce entry cannot match.

- [SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES] ✓ (60% vs 34%)
- [AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE] ✓
- [PROPER CITATION] ✓

This broader access matters because career paths rarely unfold as
planned; the average American changes careers—not just jobs—five
to seven times during their working life.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 3 (Explanation):**
- [EXPLAINS WHY EVIDENCE MATTERS] ✓
- [ADDITIONAL DATA] ✓ (5-7 career changes)
- Semicolon used correctly for related independent clauses
- Distinguishes between jobs and careers (sophistication)

---

```
A college degree serves as a universal credential that opens doors
across industries, while trade certifications, though valuable,
typically qualify workers only for positions within their specific
trade.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 4 (Explanation continued):**
- [COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVE] ✓
- [FAIR TO OPPOSITION] ✓ ("though valuable")
- Explains the difference in credential transferability

- [BROADENS SIGNIFICANCE] ✓
- [CONNECTS TO LARGER THEMES] ✓ (automation, disruption)

### BODY PARAGRAPH 3: Counterargument and Rebuttal (Part of 15/15)

```
While proponents of trade schools and immediate employment raise valid
points—including the ability to earn income immediately, avoid student
debt, and learn practical skills—these advantages diminish significantly
when examined over a full career span.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 1 (Topic Sentence - Acknowledges Opposition):**
- [FAIR ACKNOWLEDGMENT] ✓ ("raise valid points")
- [LISTS OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS] ✓ (immediate income, no debt, practical skills)
- [REBUTS] ✓ ("diminish significantly over a full career")
- One claim: Short-term advantages don't outweigh long-term benefits
- Sophisticated counterargument structure

---

```
Trade school graduates do typically begin earning sooner, and many
trades offer starting salaries that exceed entry-level positions
available to new college graduates.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 2 (Presents Opposition's Strongest Point):**
- [FAIR PRESENTATION] ✓
- [CONCEDES LEGITIMATE POINT] ✓
- Doesn't strawman the opposition

that by age 34, college graduates' earnings surpass those of trade
workers, and this gap widens continuously through retirement
(Federal Reserve Bank of New York).
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 3 (Rebuttal with Evidence):**
- [TRANSITION TO REBUTTAL] ✓ ("However")
- [SPECIFIC DATA] ✓ (age 34 crossover)
- [NEW SOURCE] ✓ (Federal Reserve)
- [PROPER CITATION] ✓
- Directly addresses the "earn sooner" argument with data

---

```
Additionally, trade work often involves physical demands that become
increasingly difficult to sustain; Bureau of Labor Statistics data
shows that workers in physically demanding occupations report higher
rates of chronic injury and earlier workforce exit than their
office-based counterparts (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 4 (Additional Rebuttal Evidence):**
- [SECOND REBUTTAL POINT] ✓ (physical toll)
- [EVIDENCE] ✓ (injury rates, early exit)
- [PROPER CITATION] ✓
- Semicolon correctly joins related clauses
- Adds dimension beyond just earnings

---

```
These long-term realities—earnings crossover, physical toll, and
career ceiling—reveal that the short-term advantages of skipping
college come at the cost of long-term financial security and
physical wellbeing.

### CONCLUSION (15/15 Points)

```
The evidence demonstrates conclusively that for most students, pursuing
a college degree represents the wisest investment in their professional
futures.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 1 (Restated Thesis):**
- [DIFFERENT WORDS] ✓ (not copied from intro)
- Original: "strongest investment" → Conclusion: "wisest investment"
- Shows what has been PROVEN, not just claimed
- Strong, confident language

---

```
With substantially higher lifetime earnings, access to a broader range
of career opportunities, and the flexibility to adapt as industries
evolve, college graduates are positioned for long-term success in ways
that trade school and immediate employment cannot replicate.
```

- [ALL THREE POINTS REFERENCED] ✓
  1. "Higher lifetime earnings" = Body ¶1 ✓

opportunity or financial security over a full career.
```

- [ACKNOWLEDGES NUANCE] ✓
- [DOESN'T UNDERMINE THESIS] ✓
- "May suit" is reasonable acknowledgment

the same conclusion: higher education pays dividends that compound
over decades.
```

- [NO NEW INFORMATION] ✓ (just summarizes)
- Colon creates emphasis
- "Compound over decades" echoes body paragraph analysis

is not merely preparation for a first job—it is the foundation for a
lifetime of professional growth and financial stability.
```

**ANNOTATION - SENTENCE 5 (Final Thought):**
- [MEMORABLE CLOSING] ✓
- [FORWARD-LOOKING] ✓
