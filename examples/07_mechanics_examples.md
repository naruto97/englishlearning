## COMPONENT 1: SPELLING

### Common Spelling Errors to Avoid

**Homophones (Sound-Alike Words):**

| Wrong | Correct | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| their/there/they're | depends on meaning | Their earnings increase. / There are benefits. / They're going to college. |
| your/you're | depends on meaning | Your career (possessive) / You're succeeding (you are) |
| its/it's | depends on meaning | Its value (possessive) / It's important (it is) |
| affect/effect | depends on meaning | College affects earnings (verb) / The effect is positive (noun) |
| than/then | depends on meaning | More than expected (comparison) / Then they graduate (sequence) |
| to/too/two | depends on meaning | Go to college / Too expensive / Two options |

---

### WHAT TO DO: Correct Spelling

**Example A: their/there/they're**
> "College graduates increase their earning potential. There are multiple benefits beyond salary. They're positioned for long-term success."

- their = belonging to them (possessive)
- there = location or existence ("there are")
- they're = they are (contraction)

**Example B: its/it's**
> "A college degree has its advantages. It's worth the investment."

- its = belonging to it (possessive, NO apostrophe)
- it's = it is (contraction)

**Example C: affect/effect**
> "Education affects career outcomes. The effect is significant."

- affect = verb (to influence)
- effect = noun (the result)

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Spelling Mistakes

**Bad Example A:**
> "Their are many reasons to attend college. Its important for you're future."

**Errors:**
- "Their are" → "There are"
- "Its important" → "It's important"
- "you're future" → "your future"

**Corrected:**
> "There are many reasons to attend college. It's important for your future."

---

**Bad Example B:**
> "College students earn more then non-graduates. This affects there future significantly."

**Errors:**
- "more then" → "more than"
- "there future" → "their future"

**Corrected:**
> "College students earn more than non-graduates. This affects their future significantly."

---

### Commonly Misspelled Academic Words

| Misspelled | Correct |
|------------|---------|
| definately | definitely |
| seperate | separate |
| occured | occurred |
| recieve | receive |
| benifit | benefit |
| arguement | argument |
| occassion | occasion |
| accomodate | accommodate |
| neccessary | necessary |
| relavant | relevant |

---

## COMPONENT 2: PUNCTUATION

### Comma Rules for Academic Writing

**Rule 1: After Introductory Elements**

*Correct:*
> "Despite the initial cost, college provides long-term benefits."
> "According to recent data, graduates earn significantly more."
> "In contrast to trade workers, college graduates have more options."

*Incorrect:*
> "Despite the initial cost college provides long-term benefits."

---

**Rule 2: Before Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS) in Compound Sentences**

FANBOYS = For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So

*Correct:*
> "College is expensive, but the investment pays off."
> "Graduates earn more, and they have greater job security."

*Incorrect:*
> "College is expensive but the investment pays off."

**Note:** Only use comma if BOTH sides could be complete sentences.

*No comma needed:*
> "College provides higher earnings and greater flexibility."
(After "and" is not a complete sentence)

---

**Rule 3: Around Non-Essential Information**

*Correct:*
> "Trade schools, which offer hands-on training, appeal to some students."
> "Anthony Carnevale, an economist at Georgetown, has studied this issue extensively."

*Incorrect:*
> "Trade schools which offer hands-on training appeal to some students."

---

**Rule 4: In Lists (Serial/Oxford Comma)**

*Correct:*
> "College provides higher earnings, career flexibility, and job security."

*Acceptable (but less clear):*
> "College provides higher earnings, career flexibility and job security."

**Recommendation:** Use the Oxford comma (comma before "and" in lists) for clarity.

---

### Semicolon Rules

**Rule 1: Between Independent Clauses Without Conjunction**

*Correct:*
> "College graduates earn more; this advantage compounds over time."

Both sides could be complete sentences. Semicolon joins them.

*Incorrect:*
> "College graduates earn more, this advantage compounds over time."

This is a COMMA SPLICE error. Use semicolon or period.

---

**Rule 2: Before Conjunctive Adverbs**

Conjunctive adverbs: however, therefore, moreover, consequently, furthermore, nevertheless

*Correct:*
> "Trade work pays well initially; however, earnings plateau over time."
> "College requires investment; therefore, some students hesitate."

*Incorrect:*
> "Trade work pays well initially, however, earnings plateau over time."

---

### Apostrophe Rules

**Rule 1: Possessives (Singular)**
> "The graduate's salary" (one graduate)
> "The university's programs" (one university)

**Rule 2: Possessives (Plural)**
> "The graduates' salaries" (multiple graduates)
> "The universities' programs" (multiple universities)

**Rule 3: NO Apostrophe for Plurals**
> "College graduates earn more." ✓
> "College graduate's earn more." ✗

**Rule 4: Its vs. It's**
> "The degree has its advantages." (possessive = no apostrophe)
> "It's important to consider." (it is = apostrophe)

---

### Citation Punctuation

**Rule: Period Goes AFTER Parenthetical Citation**

*Correct:*
> "College graduates earn more (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

*Incorrect:*
> "College graduates earn more. (Bureau of Labor Statistics)"
> "College graduates earn more (Bureau of Labor Statistics.)"

---

## COMPONENT 3: GRAMMAR

### Subject-Verb Agreement

**Rule: Subjects and Verbs Must Agree in Number**

*Correct:*
> "The data show that graduates earn more." (data = plural)
> "The evidence shows that college pays off." (evidence = singular)
> "Each of the students has options." (each = singular)

*Incorrect:*
> "The data shows that graduates earn more."
> "Each of the students have options."

**Tricky Cases:**

| Subject | Verb | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| data | plural (show) | The data show... |
| evidence | singular (shows) | The evidence shows... |
| each | singular (has) | Each has... |
| none | singular (is) | None of this is... |
| number of | singular (is) | The number of graduates is... |
| a number of | plural (are) | A number of students are... |

---

### Pronoun Agreement

**Rule: Pronouns Must Agree with Their Antecedents**

*Correct:*
> "A student should complete their assignments." (singular they = acceptable)
> "Students should complete their assignments."
> "The college provides its students with resources."

*Incorrect:*
> "A student should complete his assignments." (gendered assumption)
> "The college provides their students with resources." (college = it)

---

### Verb Tense Consistency

**Rule: Stay in Present Tense for Research and General Facts**

*Correct:*
> "Research shows that graduates earn more."
> "The data indicate a significant gap."
> "Studies confirm the value of education."

*Incorrect:*
> "Research showed that graduates earned more." (implies outdated)

**Exception:** Use past tense for specific historical events:
> "The 2008 recession demonstrated that degrees provide protection."

---

### Parallel Structure

**Rule: Items in a Series Should Follow the Same Grammatical Form**

*Correct:*
> "College provides higher earnings, greater flexibility, and stronger security."
(All noun phrases)

> "Graduates can earn more, advance faster, and adapt better."
(All verb phrases)

*Incorrect:*
> "College provides higher earnings, you get more flexibility, and security is stronger."
(Mixed structures: noun phrase, clause, clause)

---

### Avoiding Fragments and Run-Ons

**Fragment (Incomplete Sentence):**
> "Because college graduates earn more." ✗

This is a dependent clause with no independent clause.

*Fix:*
> "College is worth the cost because graduates earn more." ✓

---

**Run-On (Two Sentences Jammed Together):**
> "College graduates earn more this is significant." ✗

*Fixes:*
> "College graduates earn more. This is significant." (Two sentences)
> "College graduates earn more; this is significant." (Semicolon)
> "College graduates earn more, and this is significant." (Comma + conjunction)

---

**Comma Splice (Run-On with Comma):**
> "College graduates earn more, this advantage compounds." ✗

*Fixes:*
> "College graduates earn more; this advantage compounds."
> "College graduates earn more. This advantage compounds."
> "College graduates earn more, and this advantage compounds."

---

## COMPONENT 4: SENTENCE VARIETY

### The Four Sentence Types

**1. Simple Sentence**
One independent clause.
> "College graduates earn more."

**2. Compound Sentence**
Two independent clauses joined by conjunction.
> "College is expensive, but the returns are substantial."

**3. Complex Sentence**
Independent clause + dependent clause.
> "Although college is expensive, the returns are substantial."
> "The returns are substantial because college provides valuable skills."

**4. Compound-Complex Sentence**
Multiple independent clauses + at least one dependent clause.
> "Although some argue that trade school avoids debt, research shows that college graduates recover costs quickly, and they continue earning more throughout their careers."

---

### WHAT TO DO: Varied Sentence Structures

**Example Paragraph with Variety:**

> "College graduates consistently earn more over their lifetimes. [SIMPLE] According to federal data, the earnings gap exceeds $30,000 annually, and this difference compounds over a forty-year career. [COMPOUND] Although trade workers may earn more initially, college graduates surpass them by their mid-thirties. [COMPLEX] This crossover point matters significantly because workers typically have three decades of employment remaining, during which college graduates accumulate substantial additional wealth. [COMPLEX] The financial case for college is clear. [SIMPLE]"

**Analysis:**
- Simple sentences: 2
- Compound sentences: 1
- Complex sentences: 2
- Varied lengths: Yes
- Varied openings: Yes

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Repetitive Structures

**Bad Example (All Simple, Same Pattern):**

> "College graduates earn more money. Trade workers earn less money. College provides more opportunities. Trade school provides fewer opportunities. College is the better choice. Trade school is not the better choice."

**Problems:**
- All simple sentences
- Same subject-verb-object pattern
- Same sentence length
- Same opening word pattern
- Monotonous to read

---

**Bad Example (All Starting with Subject):**

> "College graduates earn more. They also have more flexibility. They experience lower unemployment. They can change careers more easily. They benefit in many ways."

**Problem:** Every sentence starts with the subject. No variety in sentence openings.

**Fix:** Vary the openings:
> "College graduates earn more. Additionally, they enjoy greater career flexibility. During economic downturns, their unemployment rates remain lower. When industries change, they can pivot more easily. These advantages combine to create lasting benefits."

---

### Sentence Opening Variations

**Start with Subject:**
> "College graduates earn substantially more."

**Start with Transition:**
> "Additionally, college provides career flexibility."

**Start with Dependent Clause:**
> "Although the investment is significant, the returns justify the cost."

**Start with Prepositional Phrase:**
> "According to recent data, the earnings gap continues to widen."

**Start with Present Participle:**
> "Considering these advantages, college emerges as the stronger choice."

## FORMAL ACADEMIC TONE

### What to Avoid and Use Instead

| Informal (Avoid) | Formal (Use) |
|------------------|--------------|
| Contractions (don't, can't, won't) | Full forms (do not, cannot, will not) |
| First person (I think, I believe, my opinion) | Third person (evidence suggests, research indicates) |
| Second person (you, your) | Third person (students, graduates, one) |
| Slang (a lot, kind of, really, stuff) | Precise terms (significantly, somewhat, considerably, factors) |
| Questions in body | Statements |
| Exclamation points | Periods |

---

### WHAT TO DO: Formal Academic Tone

**Example A (Formal):**
> "Evidence strongly supports college as the optimal choice for most students. Research indicates that graduates earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those without degrees."

**Example B (Formal):**
> "The data demonstrate a substantial earnings gap between degree holders and high school graduates. This difference persists across decades and economic conditions."

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO: Informal Tone

**Bad Example A:**
> "I think college is definitely the best choice! You can earn a lot more money with a degree."

**Problems:**
- First person ("I think")
- Exclamation point
- Second person ("You")
- Vague language ("a lot")

**Corrected:**
> "Evidence strongly supports college as the best choice. Degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetimes."

---

**Bad Example B:**
> "Don't you think it's kind of obvious that college is worth it? I mean, who wouldn't want to make more money?"

**Problems:**
- Second person question
- Contraction ("Don't")
- Informal ("kind of," "I mean")
- Rhetorical question

**Corrected:**
> "The value of college education is evident in the data. The substantial earnings premium makes higher education a sound investment for most students."

## COMPLETE PARAGRAPH COMPARISONS

### Distinguished Level (10/10)

> "College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only high school diplomas (Bureau of Labor Statistics). This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income. Although the initial investment in tuition and foregone wages is substantial, research demonstrates that graduates typically recover these costs within a decade (Carnevale). Over the remaining three decades of a typical career, the earnings advantage compounds into more than one million dollars in additional lifetime wealth."

**Analysis:**
- Spelling: No errors ✓
- Punctuation: All correct ✓
- Grammar: No errors ✓
- Sentence variety: Simple, complex, compound ✓
- Tone: Formal academic ✓

---

### Proficient Level (8/10)

> "College graduates earn more money over their lifetimes then those who don't go to college. Workers with bachelor's degrees earn $1,432 weekly compared to $853 for high school graduates (Bureau of Labor Statistics). This is a big difference that adds up over time. Research shows graduates recover their costs within ten years. After that they keep earning more for thirty more years."

**Errors:**
- "then" should be "than"
- Missing comma: "After that, they"
- Some informal language ("big difference")
- Sentence variety is limited

---

### Basic Level (6/10)

> "College graduates earn more money. They earn more then people who don't go to college. Their is a big difference in how much they make. College is expensive but its worth it. Graduates earn alot more over their lifetime and this is important for there future."

**Errors:**
- "then" → "than"
- "Their is" → "There is"
- "its" → "it's"
- "alot" → "a lot"
- "there future" → "their future"
- All simple sentences (no variety)

---

## PROOFREADING STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Read Backward
Start with the last sentence and read backward. This helps you see each sentence in isolation, catching errors you'd miss reading forward.

### Strategy 2: Read Aloud
Reading aloud helps catch awkward phrasing, missing words, and punctuation errors.

### Strategy 3: Focus on One Error Type
Read once for spelling, once for punctuation, once for grammar. Trying to catch everything at once often means catching nothing.

### Strategy 4: Use a Checklist
Go through specific items: contractions, homophones, comma splices, subject-verb agreement.

### Strategy 5: Wait Before Editing
Write your draft, then wait at least a few hours before proofreading. Fresh eyes catch more errors.
