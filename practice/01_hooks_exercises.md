- Hook B: **Statistic** (specific number: $1.2 million)
- Hook C: **Scenario** (paints a picture: "Every May...")
- Hook D: **Bold Statement** (makes a superlative claim: "most consequential")

> "Every year, 3.7 million American high school seniors must choose between immediate employment and a four-year investment that could add over one million dollars to their lifetime earnings."

**Hook B improved:**
> "The question of whether college is worth the investment has a clear answer—one that most students never fully examine before making their decision."

**Hook C improved:**
> "In an economy increasingly divided between knowledge workers and service workers, the choice made at eighteen often determines which side of that divide a person will occupy for life."

**Hook D improved:**
> "For high school graduates weighing college against trade school, the short-term calculus of immediate income versus student debt obscures a more important long-term reality."

### Exercise 3: Self-Check Questions
Ask yourself:
- Does my statistic hook include a specific number?
- Does my question hook make the reader think?
- Does my scenario hook create a vivid image?
- Does my bold statement hook make a strong, arguable claim?

### Exercise 4 Answer:
**Best choice: B**

**Why:** Option B uses a specific statistic (2.2% vs. double), creates contrast, and adds stakes (recession reference). Option A is vague ("something many students consider"). Option C uses first person and vague language ("really important").
