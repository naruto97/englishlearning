## ANSWER KEY

### Exercise 2 Sample Fixes:

**Thesis A Problem:** Weak position ("good option to consider" is non-committal), no reasons
**Fixed:** "College represents the best path for most high school graduates because it provides substantially higher earnings, greater career flexibility, and stronger job security than alternative paths."

**Thesis B Problem:** No position taken (just says both have pros/cons)
**Fixed:** "Although both paths have merits, college provides advantages that trade school cannot match: higher lifetime earnings, broader career options, and greater adaptability in a changing economy."

**Thesis C Problem:** First person ("I believe"), vague ("helps you")
**Fixed:** "College proves to be a worthwhile investment because it significantly increases lifetime earnings, expands career opportunities, and develops critical thinking skills essential for professional success."

**Thesis D Problem:** This is a question, not a statement
**Fixed:** "While college may not suit every individual, it remains the strongest choice for most students because of its proven impact on earnings, career flexibility, and long-term job security."

---

### Exercise 4 Answer:
**B. Critical thinking → Career options → Networks**

**Why:** The thesis lists reasons in this order, so body paragraphs should follow the same sequence. This creates a "smooth connection" between thesis and body.

---

### Exercise 5 Ratings:

**Thesis A:** 1/5
- Missing: Position is vague, no reasons, no counterargument

**Thesis B:** 2/5
- Missing: Only states one reason, no counterargument, position is implicit

**Thesis C:** 5/5
- Missing: Nothing—this is Distinguished level
