SCORING BREAKDOWN:
Points | Requirements
-------|-------------
15     | Exceeds 3 sentences + engaging hook + effective topic intro + clear thesis + smooth transition to body
12     | Exceeds 3 sentences + clear hook + thesis explicitly stating position

6      | At least 3 sentences + no hook OR unclear thesis
3      | Fewer than 3 sentences + no hook + no clear thesis

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPONENT 1: SENTENCE COUNT REQUIREMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Exceeds 3 sentences" = you need AT LEAST 4 sentences
Write 4-6 sentences to be safe. Each sentence must be substantial.

✓ DO: Count your sentences carefully before submitting
✗ DON'T: Pad with empty filler sentences

WHAT COUNTS AS A SENTENCE:

✓ DO - Substantial sentence:
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for high school graduates."
→ Provides specific information, advances the argument

✗ DON'T - Filler sentence:
"This is a very important topic."
→ Says nothing specific, wastes space

✗ DON'T - Fragment posing as sentence:
"Which is why college matters."
→ This is a fragment, not a complete sentence

✗ DON'T - Run-on counting as one:
"College is important, students should consider it, many people benefit from higher education."
→ This is three sentences incorrectly punctuated as one

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPONENT 2: THE ENGAGING HOOK (Sentence 1-2)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

An "engaging hook" must CAPTURE READER INTEREST. This is what separates Distinguished (15 pts) from Proficient (12 pts).

========================
HOOK TYPE 1: SURPRISING STATISTIC
========================

✓ DO - Engaging statistic hook:
"Americans with bachelor's degrees earn, on average, $1.2 million more over their lifetimes than high school graduates—a gap that has widened every decade since 1980."

Why this works:
• Specific number ($1.2 million) creates impact
• "Widened every decade" adds urgency
• Reader is immediately curious about why

✓ DO - Another strong statistic hook:
"Every year, approximately 1.5 million Americans complete trade programs, yet by age forty, most will earn less than their college-educated counterparts who started working four years later."

Why this works:
• Presents a seeming paradox (started later but earn more)
• Specific timeframe (age forty) adds credibility
• Creates tension that demands explanation

✗ DON'T - Weak statistic hook:
"Many students go to college each year."

Why this fails:
• "Many" is vague—how many?
• No surprising element
• Reader thinks "so what?"

✗ DON'T - Statistic without context:
"66% of high school graduates go to college."

Why this fails:
• Number exists but means nothing without comparison
• Not surprising or engaging
• Doesn't connect to your argument

✗ DON'T - Made-up sounding statistics:
"Almost everyone agrees that college is important."

Why this fails:
• Not a real statistic
• "Almost everyone" is not data
• Sounds like opinion, not fact

========================
HOOK TYPE 2: PROVOCATIVE QUESTION
========================

✓ DO - Engaging question hook:
"What if the decision you make at eighteen determines not just your first job, but your earning potential, career options, and financial security for the next forty years?"

Why this works:
• Makes reader personally reflect
• Creates stakes (forty years of consequences)
• Raises genuine curiosity

✓ DO - Another strong question hook:
"Why do college graduates experience half the unemployment rate of high school graduates during economic recessions?"

Why this works:
• Presents an intriguing fact as question
• Specific (half the rate, during recessions)
• Reader wants to know the answer

✗ DON'T - Obvious question:
"Have you ever wondered if college is a good choice?"

Why this fails:
• Too generic, no specific hook
• "Have you ever wondered" is overused
• Answer seems obvious (of course people wonder)

✗ DON'T - Yes/no question:
"Is college worth it?"

Why this fails:
• Can be answered with one word
• Doesn't create engagement
• Too simple and overused

✗ DON'T - Rhetorical question with obvious answer:
"Don't we all want to earn more money?"

Why this fails:
• Answer is obviously "yes"
• Doesn't add information
• Feels manipulative rather than engaging

========================
HOOK TYPE 3: VIVID SCENARIO
========================

✓ DO - Engaging scenario hook:
"Every May, 3.7 million high school seniors face a crossroads that will shape the trajectory of their entire lives: college, trade school, or immediate employment."

Why this works:
• Paints a clear picture (May, seniors, crossroads)
• Specific number adds weight
• "Trajectory of their entire lives" creates stakes

✓ DO - Another strong scenario hook:
"Picture two classmates graduating together: one heads to a university, taking on debt; the other begins earning immediately as an apprentice. In fifteen years, their financial positions will likely have reversed."

Why this works:
• Creates concrete, relatable image
• Sets up a comparison your essay will explore
• "Likely reversed" creates intrigue

✗ DON'T - Vague scenario:
"Many students have to make a big decision after high school."

Why this fails:
• No specific imagery
• "Many students" and "big decision" are vague
• Reader can't picture anything

✗ DON'T - Clichéd scenario:
"Imagine standing at a fork in the road, wondering which path to take."

Why this fails:
• Overused metaphor
• No specific connection to topic
• Feels like filler, not substance

========================
HOOK TYPE 4: BOLD/ARGUABLE STATEMENT
========================

✓ DO - Engaging bold statement:
"The choice between college and direct workforce entry is the most consequential financial decision most young Americans will ever make—more impactful than buying a home or choosing a spouse."

Why this works:
• Takes a strong, arguable position
• Comparison is surprising and debatable
• Forces reader to engage (agree or disagree)

✓ DO - Another strong bold statement:
"Despite rising tuition costs and student debt headlines, college remains the single best investment available to the average American worker."

Why this works:
• Acknowledges counterargument (costs, debt)
• Takes clear stance
• "Single best investment" is arguable and interesting

✗ DON'T - Obvious statement:
"College is an important decision."

Why this fails:
• Everyone already knows this
• Not bold or arguable
• Doesn't capture interest

✗ DON'T - Wishy-washy statement:
"College can be a good option for some students."

Why this fails:
• Not bold—hedges with "can be" and "some"
• Doesn't take a stance
• No argument to engage with

✗ DON'T - Absolute statement that's easily dismissed:
"Everyone should go to college no matter what."

Why this fails:
• Too extreme to be credible
• Easily argued against
• Makes essay seem one-sided

========================
MASTER LIST: HOOKS THAT FAIL (AVOID THESE)
========================

✗ "This essay will discuss whether college is worth it."
   → Announces topic, doesn't hook

✗ "In today's society, education is important."
   → Vague cliché

✗ "College is a popular choice for high school graduates."
   → States the obvious, no engagement

✗ "According to the dictionary, college is defined as..."
   → Dictionary definitions are weak hooks

✗ "Since the beginning of time, people have valued education."
   → Sweeping historical claims are empty

✗ "There are many opinions about college education."
   → States the obvious without adding value

✗ "The topic of college versus trades is very controversial."
   → Tells us it's interesting instead of being interesting

✗ "I believe that college is the best choice."
   → First person and states position too plainly

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPONENT 3: EFFECTIVE TOPIC INTRODUCTION (Sentence 2-3)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

After the hook, provide CONTEXT. Explain what the debate is and why it matters.

========================
EFFECTIVE TOPIC INTRODUCTIONS
========================

✓ DO - Context that explains the debate:
"While some students head directly into trades or the workforce, seeking immediate income and avoiding student debt, others invest four years in higher education betting on long-term returns. This decision affects not only earning potential but also career flexibility, job security, and quality of life."

Why this works:
• Names the alternatives (trades, workforce, college)
• Acknowledges both sides fairly
• Lists specific stakes (earnings, flexibility, security, quality of life)
• Sets up the argument without stating the thesis yet

✓ DO - Another effective introduction:
"As tuition costs continue rising and student debt reaches $1.7 trillion nationally, more high school graduates are questioning whether a four-year degree is necessary. Meanwhile, labor shortages in skilled trades have driven up wages for electricians, plumbers, and welders. Yet the long-term data tells a more complex story."

Why this works:
• Provides current context (costs, debt levels)
• Acknowledges the counterargument (trade wages rising)
• "More complex story" creates transition to thesis
• Reader understands why this matters now

✓ DO - Concise but complete context:
"High school graduates face a choice with lifelong consequences: invest time and money in college, or enter the workforce immediately. Both paths have advocates, but the evidence strongly favors one approach for most students."

Why this works:
• Clearly states the choice
• Acknowledges both sides exist
• Creates anticipation for the thesis

========================
INEFFECTIVE TOPIC INTRODUCTIONS
========================

✗ DON'T - Too vague:
"There are different paths after high school. Some people go to college and some don't."

Why this fails:
• States the obvious without adding value
• "Different paths" and "some people" are too general
• Provides no real context or stakes

✗ DON'T - One-sided from the start:
"While some foolish students skip college to work in trades, smart students know that college is the only path to success."

Why this fails:
• Insults the other side (foolish)
• Doesn't fairly represent the debate
• Sounds biased rather than analytical
• "Only path" is demonstrably false

✗ DON'T - Too much personal opinion too early:
"I think everyone should really consider going to college because it's so important for getting a good job these days and my parents always told me education matters."

Why this fails:
• Uses first person (I, my)
• Rambles without clear point
• Personal anecdote doesn't belong in introduction
• "So important" and "these days" are vague

✗ DON'T - Jumping straight to thesis without context:
"College is the best choice because of higher earnings, better job security, and more flexibility."

Why this fails:
• This is the thesis, not context
• Reader has no understanding of the debate
• No setup for why this argument matters

✗ DON'T - Too much history:
"Since the founding of Harvard in 1636, Americans have valued higher education. Throughout the centuries, colleges have grown from small religious institutions to massive research universities. Today, there are over 4,000 degree-granting institutions in the United States."

Why this fails:
• Historical background is not context for the argument
• Doesn't explain the current debate
• Wastes valuable introduction space

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPONENT 4: THESIS STATEMENT WITH CLEAR POSITION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your thesis must EXPLICITLY STATE YOUR POSITION. The rubric specifically requires "a clear position on the argument."

========================
THESIS FORMULA
========================

[Acknowledgment of counterargument] + [Your clear position] + [Preview of reasons]

========================
STRONG THESIS STATEMENTS (DISTINGUISHED LEVEL)
========================

✓ DO - Complete thesis with all elements:
"While trade schools and immediate employment offer practical short-term benefits, college education remains the strongest path for most high school graduates because it provides greater career flexibility, significantly higher lifetime earnings, and critical thinking skills essential for adapting to an evolving economy."

Analysis:
• Acknowledgment: "While trade schools and immediate employment offer practical short-term benefits"
• Clear position: "college education remains the strongest path"
• Preview: "career flexibility, higher lifetime earnings, critical thinking skills"
• Arguable: Someone could disagree
• Specific: Three clear reasons previewed

✓ DO - Another strong thesis:
"Although entering the workforce immediately avoids student debt, pursuing a bachelor's degree remains the wisest investment for the majority of high school graduates, offering substantially higher earnings, lower unemployment risk, and career mobility that alternative paths cannot match."

Analysis:
• Acknowledges debt concern
• Takes clear stance ("wisest investment")
• Previews three specific benefits
• "Cannot match" strengthens the comparison

✓ DO - Thesis with qualifying language done right:
"Despite the rising costs of higher education, a college degree continues to offer returns—in earnings, job security, and career advancement—that far exceed those available through trade certification or direct workforce entry."

Analysis:
• Acknowledges the cost concern
• "Continues to offer" shows awareness of changing context
• "Far exceed" takes clear stance
• Lists three specific areas of comparison

========================
WEAK THESIS STATEMENTS (LOSE POINTS)
========================

✗ DON'T - Too vague:
"College is a good option for students to consider after high school."

Why this fails:
• "Good option" is not a clear position
• "To consider" hedges further
• No preview of reasons
• Not arguable (who would disagree?)

✗ DON'T - No acknowledgment of counterargument:
"College is the best choice because it offers higher earnings, better jobs, and more opportunities."

Why this fails:
• Ignores that alternatives exist
• Sounds one-sided and simplistic
• Distinguished essays show nuanced thinking

✗ DON'T - No clear position:
"There are pros and cons to both college and trade school, and students should think carefully about their options."

Why this fails:
• Doesn't take a stance
• This is a summary, not an argument
• Reader learns nothing about what you'll prove

✗ DON'T - Too extreme:
"College is the only way to succeed in life, and anyone who doesn't attend is making a terrible mistake."

Why this fails:
• Easily disproven (many successful people didn't attend college)
• Insulting to alternative paths
• Weakens your credibility

✗ DON'T - First person:
"I believe that college is the best path because I think it offers more opportunities."

Why this fails:
• "I believe" and "I think" are unnecessary
• Academic writing avoids first person
• Sounds like opinion rather than argument

✗ DON'T - Lists reasons without position:
"This essay will examine the earnings difference between college graduates and trade workers, the flexibility of college degrees, and the long-term career prospects of both paths."

Why this fails:
• This is an essay map, not a thesis
• No position stated
• Reader doesn't know what you'll argue

✗ DON'T - Position without reasons:
"College is better than trade school."

Why this fails:
• Too short and unsupported
• No preview of why
• Sounds like mere assertion

========================
THESIS POSITION LANGUAGE COMPARISON
========================

VAGUE (loses points)        →    CLEAR (earns full points)
"can be beneficial"         →    "remains the strongest path"
"might be worth it"         →    "proves to be the wisest investment"
"has some advantages"       →    "offers unmatched benefits"
"is a good choice"          →    "is the superior choice"
"could be important"        →    "is essential for"
"is one way to"            →    "is the most effective way to"

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPONENT 5: SMOOTH CONNECTION TO FIRST BODY PARAGRAPH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The rubric specifically requires "smooth connection to body paragraph 1."

========================
HOW TO CREATE SMOOTH CONNECTION
========================

Your thesis previews your reasons. Your first body paragraph should address the first reason.

✓ DO - Thesis previews in order:
Thesis: "...college provides (1) greater career flexibility, (2) significantly higher lifetime earnings, and (3) critical thinking skills..."

Body ¶1 begins: "The financial advantages of a college education become clear when examining lifetime earnings data."

→ Body ¶1 addresses reason #2 (earnings) because that's the strongest lead
→ This is SMOOTH because readers can follow the logic

✓ DO - Thesis and body connection:
Thesis ends: "...significantly higher lifetime earnings, career flexibility, and adaptable skills."
Body ¶1 starts: "The most immediate and measurable advantage of college education appears in lifetime earnings data."

→ Reader knows exactly why you're discussing earnings
→ "Most immediate and measurable" explains why this comes first

✗ DON'T - Disconnect between thesis and body:
Thesis: "College provides higher earnings, flexibility, and critical thinking skills."
Body ¶1: "College campuses offer many social opportunities for students to make lifelong friends and connections."

→ Social opportunities weren't in the thesis
→ Reader is confused about the essay's direction
→ This feels disorganized

✗ DON'T - No clear transition to body:
Thesis ends: "...essential for adapting to an evolving economy."
Body ¶1 starts: "Many students worry about the cost of college."

→ Jump from "adapting to economy" to "cost" is jarring
→ No smooth connection

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMPLETE INTRODUCTION EXAMPLES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

========================
EXAMPLE 1: DISTINGUISHED INTRODUCTION (15/15)
========================

"Every May, approximately 3.7 million American high school seniors face a decision that will fundamentally shape their financial futures. [HOOK - engaging, specific statistic + scenario] While some choose immediate employment or trade certifications to avoid student debt and begin earning right away, others invest in four-year degrees, betting on higher long-term returns. [CONTEXT - names alternatives, shows understanding] The stakes are significant: research consistently shows that education level correlates strongly with lifetime earnings, unemployment rates, and career advancement opportunities. [CONTEXT - explains why it matters] Although trade schools and direct workforce entry provide practical short-term benefits, college education remains the strongest investment for most high school graduates because it delivers superior lifetime earnings, unmatched career flexibility, and adaptable skills essential for navigating an evolving economy. [THESIS - clear position with preview]"

Checklist:
✓ Sentence count: 4 sentences (exceeds 3)
✓ Engaging hook: Yes (specific number, vivid image)
✓ Effective topic introduction: Yes (explains both sides, establishes stakes)
✓ Clear thesis with position: Yes ("remains the strongest investment")
✓ Previews reasons: Yes (earnings, flexibility, skills)
✓ Smooth connection to body: Yes (first body paragraph can address any of the three previewed reasons)

========================
EXAMPLE 2: DISTINGUISHED INTRODUCTION (15/15) - DIFFERENT APPROACH
========================

"Why do college graduates experience unemployment rates half those of their peers with only high school diplomas—even during the worst economic downturns? [HOOK - provocative question with specific data] This striking disparity reflects a broader pattern: across virtually every measure of economic wellbeing, from weekly wages to retirement savings, those with bachelor's degrees consistently outperform those without. [CONTEXT - establishes the pattern] As debates continue over rising tuition costs and growing student debt, the fundamental value proposition of higher education deserves careful examination. [CONTEXT - acknowledges current concerns] Despite legitimate concerns about the cost of college, the evidence demonstrates that a four-year degree remains the single most reliable path to financial security, offering graduates substantially higher lifetime earnings, greater resilience during economic downturns, and access to a broader range of career opportunities than any alternative. [THESIS - clear position acknowledging counterargument]"

Checklist:
✓ Sentence count: 4 sentences (exceeds 3)
✓ Engaging hook: Yes (question with surprising statistic)
✓ Effective topic introduction: Yes (establishes pattern, current context)
✓ Clear thesis with position: Yes ("single most reliable path")
✓ Previews reasons: Yes (earnings, resilience, opportunities)
✓ Smooth connection to body: Yes

========================
EXAMPLE 3: PROFICIENT INTRODUCTION (12/15) - LOSES SOME POINTS
========================

"Many high school students have to decide whether to go to college or start working. [WEAK HOOK - vague] Some students choose college while others prefer to enter trades or get jobs right away. [CONTEXT - too basic] There are advantages and disadvantages to both paths, and the right choice depends on individual circumstances. [WAFFLING - no clear position yet] However, for most students, college is the best choice because it leads to higher earnings and better job opportunities. [THESIS - clear but weak preview]"

What's wrong:
• Hook is not engaging (no specific data, not interesting)
• "Many students" and "have to decide" are vague
• Middle sentences add nothing substantive
• Thesis has position but weak preview (only "higher earnings and better job opportunities")
• Missing the third reason that would strengthen the thesis

========================
EXAMPLE 4: BASIC INTRODUCTION (9/15) - SIGNIFICANT POINT LOSS
========================

"College is an important topic that many people discuss. [WEAK HOOK] After high school, there are different options available. [VAGUE CONTEXT] In my opinion, students should go to college because it is a good choice that can help them in their careers. [WEAK THESIS]"

What's wrong:
• Hook is not engaging at all
• "Many people discuss" adds nothing
• "Different options" is too vague
• "In my opinion" uses first person
• "Good choice" is not a clear position
• "Can help them in their careers" is vague
• Only 3 sentences (doesn't exceed 3)

========================
EXAMPLE 5: BELOW EXPECTATIONS (6/15)
========================

"Should students go to college? Some people think yes and some people think no. I think college is worth it."

What's wrong:
• Yes/no question is weak hook
• No real context or explanation
• Uses first person (I)
• Thesis has no preview of reasons
• Only 3 sentences (doesn't exceed 3)
• No smooth connection to body

========================
EXAMPLE 6: NON-PERFORMANCE (3/15)
========================

"College versus trades is the topic of this essay."

What's wrong:
• Only 1 sentence
• No hook at all
• No context
• No thesis
• Simply announces topic

SCORING BREAKDOWN:
Points | Requirements
-------|-------------
15     | 3+ paragraphs, each exceeds 3 sentences, one claim per paragraph, fully developed, detailed examples, effective transitions
12     | 2 paragraphs, each exceeds 3 sentences, one claim per paragraph, detailed examples

3      | Fewer than 3 sentences, inadequate detail, weak examples

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT 1: PARAGRAPH COUNT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You MUST have THREE body paragraphs minimum for Distinguished.

✓ DO: Write exactly three body paragraphs (or more if needed)
✗ DON'T: Write only one or two body paragraphs

POINT PENALTIES FOR FEWER PARAGRAPHS:
• Three paragraphs = Eligible for 15 points
• Two paragraphs = Maximum 12 points (automatic 3-point loss)
• One paragraph = Maximum 9 points (automatic 6-point loss)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT 2: SENTENCE COUNT PER PARAGRAPH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Each body paragraph must EXCEED 3 sentences (minimum 4 sentences).

✓ DO: Write 5-7 sentences per body paragraph
✗ DON'T: Write only 3 sentences per paragraph

WHY 5-7 SENTENCES IS IDEAL:

Sentence 1: Topic sentence (claim)
Sentence 2: Introduction of evidence
Sentence 3: Evidence with citation
Sentence 4: Explanation of evidence
Sentence 5: Further analysis or additional evidence
Sentence 6: Connection back to thesis or transition

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT 3: ONE CLAIM PER PARAGRAPH
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Each body paragraph should focus on ONE main argument.

========================
ONE CLAIM - WHAT IT MEANS
========================

✓ DO - One focused claim:
"College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school."

This paragraph will ONLY discuss earnings. Everything in the paragraph supports this one claim.

✗ DON'T - Multiple claims crammed together:
"College graduates earn more money, have better job security, and also get more respect in society, plus they have better health outcomes and live longer."

This tries to prove too much in one paragraph. Each of these could be its own paragraph.

========================
TOPIC SENTENCE EXAMPLES (STATES THE CLAIM)
========================

✓ DO - Clear, focused topic sentences:

For Body ¶1 (Earnings claim):
"College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school."

For Body ¶2 (Flexibility claim):
"Beyond financial benefits, college education provides unmatched career flexibility that becomes increasingly valuable in a rapidly changing economy."

For Body ¶3 (Counterargument/Rebuttal):
"While proponents of trade schools and immediate employment raise valid concerns about student debt and practical skills, these advantages diminish significantly when examined over a full career span."

✗ DON'T - Vague topic sentences:

"There are many reasons why college is good."
→ Not specific, doesn't state a clear claim

"Another thing to consider is jobs."
→ What about jobs? What's the claim?

"This paragraph will talk about money."
→ Announces topic, doesn't make an argument

"College has benefits."
→ Too vague, could mean anything

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT 4: FULLY DEVELOPED WITH DETAILED EXAMPLES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The difference between "detailed examples" (15 points) and "general examples" (9 points) is crucial.

========================
DETAILED VS. GENERAL EXAMPLES
========================

✓ DO - DETAILED EXAMPLE (earns full points):
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics). This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income. Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only high school diplomas."

Why this is detailed:
• Specific numbers ($1,432, $853, $600, $30,000, $1.2 million)
• Named source (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
• Proper citation
• Math explained for the reader
• Timeframe specified (forty-year career)

✗ DON'T - GENERAL EXAMPLE (loses points):
"College graduates make more money than people who don't go to college. Studies show that education leads to higher income. This means college is a good investment."

Why this is too general:
• No specific numbers
• "Studies show" - which studies? Cite them!
• "More money" - how much more?
• No source named
• No analysis or explanation

========================
MORE DETAILED VS. GENERAL COMPARISONS
========================

✗ GENERAL: "Trade workers can get injured on the job."
✓ DETAILED: "Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates that workers in physically demanding occupations report chronic injury rates 2.3 times higher than office-based workers, with construction trades experiencing the highest rates of career-ending injuries before age 55 (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

✗ GENERAL: "College graduates have more job options."
✓ DETAILED: "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's degrees have access to over 60% of job postings in the current market, compared to only 34% for those with high school diplomas alone (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

✗ GENERAL: "Unemployment is lower for college graduates."
✓ DETAILED: "The unemployment rate for bachelor's degree holders stands at 2.2%, compared to 4.0% for high school graduates—nearly double the rate—according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

✗ GENERAL: "College degrees help during recessions."
✓ DETAILED: "During the 2008 financial crisis, workers with only high school diplomas experienced unemployment rates exceeding 10%, while college graduates saw rates peak at just 5%, according to Federal Reserve data (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)."

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use this structure for every body paragraph:

T - Topic Sentence (States ONE claim, connects to thesis)
E - Evidence (Specific data, statistics, or quotes WITH citation)
E - Explanation (Analyzes WHY the evidence supports your claim)
L - Link (Connects back to thesis OR transitions to next paragraph)

========================
TEEL BREAKDOWN WITH EXAMPLES
========================

T - TOPIC SENTENCE:

✓ DO:
"College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school."

✗ DON'T:
"Money is important."
"This paragraph is about earnings."
"Another reason is salary."

---

E - EVIDENCE (with citation):

✓ DO:
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

✗ DON'T:
"College graduates make more money."
→ Where's the data? Where's the source?

✗ DON'T:
"Studies show that people with degrees earn more (studies)."
→ "Studies" is not a valid citation

✗ DON'T:
"It is well known that college pays off."
→ "Well known" is not evidence

---

E - EXPLANATION (analysis):

✓ DO:
"This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income. Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only high school diplomas. Even accounting for tuition costs and foregone income during the college years, graduates typically recover their educational investment within a decade."

Why this works:
• Does the math for the reader
• Extends the analysis over time
• Addresses a potential objection (tuition costs)
• Shows the reader why the evidence matters

✗ DON'T:
"This shows that college is worth it."

Why this fails:
• Doesn't explain HOW it shows anything
• Doesn't analyze the evidence
• Simply restates the claim
• Misses the opportunity to demonstrate understanding

✗ DON'T:
"This evidence proves that college graduates earn more money than non-graduates."

Why this fails:
• Just restates what the evidence said
• No analysis or deeper thinking
• Doesn't connect to the broader argument

---

L - LINK (connection):

✓ DO - Links back to thesis:
"This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that despite initial costs, college education delivers a return on investment that direct workforce entry cannot match."

✓ DO - Transitions to next paragraph:
"While these financial advantages are compelling on their own, college education offers benefits beyond earnings that prove equally valuable over a career."

✗ DON'T:
"This is why college is good."
→ Too vague, doesn't connect specifically

✗ DON'T:
"Moving on to my next point..."
→ Too mechanical, breaks flow

========================
BODY PARAGRAPH 1: EARNINGS ARGUMENT - DISTINGUISHED (15/15 contribution)
========================

"College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school. [TOPIC SENTENCE - one clear claim] According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [EVIDENCE - specific numbers, named source, proper citation] This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income. [EXPLANATION - does the math] Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only high school diplomas. [EXPLANATION - extends the analysis] Even accounting for tuition costs and foregone income during the college years, research from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce shows that graduates typically recover their educational investment within a decade (Carnevale). [ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE with citation, addresses counterargument] This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that despite initial costs, college education delivers a return on investment that direct workforce entry cannot match. [LINK - connects to thesis]"

ANALYSIS:
✓ Exceeds 3 sentences: 6 sentences
✓ One claim: Earnings advantage
✓ Detailed examples: $1,432, $853, $600, $30,000, $1.2 million
✓ Proper citations: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Carnevale
✓ Explanation present: Math shown, analysis extended over time
✓ Link to thesis: Yes

========================
BODY PARAGRAPH 2: FLEXIBILITY ARGUMENT - DISTINGUISHED (15/15 contribution)
========================

"Beyond financial benefits, college education provides unmatched career flexibility that becomes increasingly valuable in a rapidly changing economy. [TOPIC SENTENCE with transition] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that workers with bachelor's degrees have access to over 60% of job postings in the current market, compared to only 34% for those with high school diplomas alone (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [EVIDENCE - specific percentages, proper citation] This broader access matters because career paths rarely unfold as planned; the average American changes careers—not just jobs—five to seven times during their working life. [EXPLANATION - shows why evidence matters] A college degree serves as a universal credential that opens doors across industries, while trade certifications, though valuable, typically qualify workers only for positions within their specific trade. [FURTHER EXPLANATION - develops the point] For example, an electrician seeking to transition into project management, sales, or business ownership may find doors closed without additional credentials, whereas a college graduate can pivot between fields more readily. [DETAILED EXAMPLE - concrete illustration] This flexibility provides not merely convenience but essential insurance against industry disruption, automation, and the unpredictable evolution of the job market. [LINK - connects to thesis]"

ANALYSIS:
✓ Exceeds 3 sentences: 6 sentences
✓ One claim: Career flexibility
✓ Transition from previous paragraph: "Beyond financial benefits"
✓ Detailed examples: 60%, 34%, 5-7 career changes, specific trades mentioned
✓ Explanation present: Shows why access matters
✓ Link to thesis: Yes

========================
BODY PARAGRAPH 3: COUNTERARGUMENT/REBUTTAL - DISTINGUISHED (15/15 contribution)
========================

"While proponents of trade schools and immediate employment raise valid points—including the ability to earn income immediately, avoid student debt, and learn practical skills—these advantages diminish significantly when examined over a full career span. [TOPIC SENTENCE - acknowledges opposing view fairly] Trade school graduates do typically begin earning sooner, and many trades offer starting salaries that exceed entry-level positions available to new college graduates. [PRESENTS opposing argument fairly] However, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that by age 34, college graduates' earnings surpass those of trade workers, and this gap widens continuously through retirement (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). [REBUTTAL with evidence and citation] Additionally, trade work often involves physical demands that become increasingly difficult to sustain; Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that workers in physically demanding occupations report higher rates of chronic injury and earlier workforce exit than their office-based counterparts (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [ADDITIONAL REBUTTAL with second citation] These long-term realities—earnings crossover, physical toll, and career ceiling—reveal that the short-term advantages of skipping college come at the cost of long-term financial security and physical wellbeing. [LINK - reinforces thesis]"

ANALYSIS:
✓ Exceeds 3 sentences: 5 sentences
✓ One claim: Short-term trade advantages don't outweigh long-term college benefits
✓ Addresses counterargument: Fairly presents the other side first
✓ Detailed evidence: Age 34 crossover, injury rates
✓ Multiple citations: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bureau of Labor Statistics
✓ Link to thesis: Yes

BODY PARAGRAPH EXAMPLES THAT LOSE POINTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

========================
PROFICIENT BODY PARAGRAPH (12/15 contribution) - Missing Elements
========================

"College graduates earn more money than people who don't go to college. Studies show that the difference can be significant over time. Workers with degrees have higher salaries and better job prospects. This means that going to college is a good financial decision. Therefore, students should consider attending college to increase their future earnings."

What's wrong:
✗ No specific numbers (just "more money," "significant")
✗ No proper citations ("studies show" is not a citation)

What's wrong:
✗ Only 3 sentences (doesn't exceed 3)
✗ Extremely vague
✗ No evidence or citations

========================

"College helps with jobs."

What's wrong:
✗ Only 1 sentence
✗ No development at all
✗ No evidence
✗ No explanation
✗ No link to thesis

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMMON BODY PARAGRAPH MISTAKES TO AVOID
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MISTAKE 1: EVIDENCE WITHOUT EXPLANATION (Evidence Dumping)

✗ DON'T:
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's degrees earn $1,432 weekly compared to $853 for high school graduates (Bureau of Labor Statistics). Georgetown research shows similar patterns (Carnevale). The Federal Reserve also reports higher earnings for graduates (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). College clearly pays off."

What's wrong:
• Drops three pieces of evidence with no explanation
• Doesn't analyze what the data means
• Reader must figure out the significance
• Link is weak ("clearly pays off" doesn't explain anything)

✓ DO: Use one or two pieces of evidence and explain them thoroughly.

---

MISTAKE 2: EXPLANATION WITHOUT EVIDENCE (Unsupported Claims)

✗ DON'T:
"College graduates earn significantly more money, which makes the investment worthwhile. Over time, this earning advantage compounds dramatically, potentially totaling hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. When you factor in retirement savings and compound interest, the difference becomes even more substantial. This is why college remains such a valuable investment."

What's wrong:
• Strong claims with no evidence
• "Hundreds of thousands or even millions" - cite a source!
• No data to support the assertions
• Reader has no reason to believe these claims

✓ DO: Support every factual claim with cited evidence.

---

MISTAKE 3: MULTIPLE CLAIMS IN ONE PARAGRAPH

✗ DON'T:
"College has many benefits. Graduates earn more money and have lower unemployment rates. They also have better health outcomes and live longer. College provides networking opportunities and teaches critical thinking skills. The campus experience helps develop social skills. Additionally, college degrees are respected by employers."

What's wrong:
• Tries to address earnings, unemployment, health, longevity, networking, critical thinking, social skills, and respect
• Each of these could be its own paragraph
• Nothing is developed in depth

✓ DO: Choose ONE claim and develop it fully with evidence and explanation.

---

MISTAKE 4: USING "I" OR "YOU"

✗ DON'T:
"I think college is the best choice because you can earn more money. In my opinion, you should definitely consider going to college because I believe it will help you in your career."

What's wrong:
• Uses first person (I, my)
• Uses second person (you, your)
• Academic essays avoid both

✓ DO:
"College education proves to be the strongest choice because graduates earn significantly more. Students should consider the long-term earning advantages that a degree provides for career advancement."

---

MISTAKE 5: WEAK OR MISSING CITATIONS

✗ DON'T:
"Studies show that college graduates earn more (studies)."
"Research proves this point (research)."
"Many sources confirm this finding."
"It is well documented that..."
"Statistics show..."

What's wrong:
• These are not valid citations
• No specific source named
• Reader can't verify the claims

✓ DO:
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics..."
"Research from Georgetown University indicates..."
"Federal Reserve data shows..."

---

MISTAKE 6: CONCLUDING EACH PARAGRAPH WITH "IN CONCLUSION"

✗ DON'T:
"In conclusion, this paragraph has shown that college graduates earn more money."

What's wrong:
• "In conclusion" should only appear in the actual conclusion
• Sounds mechanical and repetitive
• Doesn't provide a real link

✓ DO:
"This substantial earning advantage demonstrates that college investment pays dividends throughout a career."
