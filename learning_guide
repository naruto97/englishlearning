RUBRIC REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTINGUISHED (15/15):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • Paragraph EXCEEDS 3 sentences (minimum 4 sentences required)              │
│ • Begins with an ENGAGING HOOK that captures reader interest                │
│ • Introduces the topic EFFECTIVELY                                          │

SCORING BREAKDOWN:
Points | Requirements
-------|-------------
15     | Exceeds 3 sentences + engaging hook + effective topic intro + clear thesis + smooth transition to body
12     | Exceeds 3 sentences + clear hook + thesis explicitly stating position
9      | At least 3 sentences + weak/unengaging hook + thesis mentions position without clarity
6      | At least 3 sentences + no hook OR unclear thesis
3      | Fewer than 3 sentences + no hook + no clear thesis

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR WRITING:

Sentence Count Requirement:
- "Exceeds 3 sentences" = you need AT LEAST 4 sentences
- Write 4-6 sentences to be safe
- Each sentence must be substantial (not filler)

Component 1: The Engaging Hook (Sentence 1-2)
An "engaging hook" must CAPTURE READER INTEREST. This is what separates Distinguished from Proficient.

ENGAGING HOOKS (earn full points):
• Surprising statistic with immediate impact:
  "Americans with bachelor's degrees earn, on average, $1.2 million more over their lifetimes than high school graduates—a gap that has widened every decade since 1980."

• Provocative question that makes reader think:
  "What if the decision you make at eighteen determines not just your first job, but your earning potential, career options, and financial security for the next forty years?"

• Vivid scenario that creates connection:
  "Every May, 3.7 million high school seniors face a crossroads that will shape the trajectory of their entire lives: college, trade school, or immediate employment."

• Bold, arguable statement:
  "The choice between college and direct workforce entry is the most consequential financial decision most young Americans will ever make."

WEAK HOOKS (cost you points):
• "Many people go to college after high school." (Boring, no engagement)
• "This essay will discuss college education." (Announces topic, doesn't hook)
• "College is a popular choice." (Vague, uninteresting)
• "In today's society, education is important." (Cliché, empty)

Component 2: Effective Topic Introduction (Sentence 2-3)
After the hook, provide CONTEXT. Explain what the debate is and why it matters.

EFFECTIVE INTRODUCTION:
"While some students head directly into trades or the workforce, seeking immediate income and avoiding student debt, others invest four years in higher education betting on long-term returns. This decision affects not only earning potential but also career flexibility, job security, and quality of life."

This works because it:
- Names the alternatives (trades, workforce, college)
- Acknowledges both sides exist
- Explains what's at stake (earnings, flexibility, security, quality of life)

INEFFECTIVE INTRODUCTION:
"There are different paths after high school. Some people go to college and some don't."

This fails because it:
- States the obvious without adding value
- Provides no context about why this matters
- Shows no understanding of the complexity

Component 3: Thesis Statement with Clear Position (Final Sentence)
Your thesis must EXPLICITLY STATE YOUR POSITION. The rubric specifically requires "a clear position on the argument."

THESIS FORMULA:
[Topic] + [Your Clear Position] + [Preview of Reasons]

STRONG THESIS (Distinguished level):
"While trade schools and immediate employment offer practical short-term benefits, college education remains the strongest path for most high school graduates because it provides greater career flexibility, significantly higher lifetime earnings, and critical thinking skills essential for adapting to an evolving economy."

This thesis:
✓ Takes a clear position ("college education remains the strongest path")
✓ Acknowledges the counterargument ("trade schools and immediate employment offer practical short-term benefits")
✓ Previews three supporting reasons (flexibility, earnings, critical thinking)
✓ Is specific and arguable

WEAK THESIS (costs points):
"College is a good option for students to consider after high school."

This thesis:
✗ Position is vague ("good option" vs. "strongest path")
✗ No preview of reasons
✗ Not clearly arguable (too safe)

Component 4: Smooth Connection to First Body Paragraph
The rubric specifically requires a "smooth connection" to body paragraph 1. This means your thesis should set up what comes next.

SMOOTH CONNECTION:
If your thesis previews "career flexibility, higher lifetime earnings, and critical thinking skills," your first body paragraph should address one of these. The reader knows exactly what's coming.

ABRUPT CONNECTION (loses points):
Thesis about career benefits → Body paragraph suddenly discussing campus social life. The reader is confused about the logical flow.

EXAMPLE DISTINGUISHED INTRODUCTION (4+ sentences):

"Every May, approximately 3.7 million American high school seniors face a decision that will fundamentally shape their financial futures [HOOK - engaging, specific]. While some choose immediate employment or trade certifications to avoid student debt and begin earning right away, others invest in four-year degrees, betting on higher long-term returns [CONTEXT - names alternatives, shows understanding]. The stakes are significant: research consistently shows that education level correlates strongly with lifetime earnings, unemployment rates, and career advancement opportunities [CONTEXT - explains why it matters]. Although trade schools and direct workforce entry provide practical short-term benefits, college education remains the strongest investment for most high school graduates because it delivers superior lifetime earnings, unmatched career flexibility, and adaptable skills essential for navigating an evolving economy [THESIS - clear position with preview]."

Sentence count: 4 ✓
Engaging hook: ✓
Effective topic introduction: ✓
Clear thesis with position: ✓
Smooth connection (previews body paragraphs): ✓

T - Topic Sentence (States ONE claim, connects to thesis)
E - Evidence (Specific data, statistics, or quotes WITH citation)
E - Explanation (Analyzes WHY the evidence supports your claim)
L - Link (Connects back to thesis OR transitions to next paragraph)

BODY PARAGRAPH 1: FINANCIAL/EARNINGS ARGUMENT

Topic Sentence (Claim):
"College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school."

This claim:
✓ Makes ONE specific argument (earnings difference)
✓ Connects to thesis (supports "higher lifetime earnings" preview)
✓ Is provable with evidence

Evidence (With Citation):
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

This evidence:
✓ Provides SPECIFIC numbers ($1,432 vs. $853)
✓ Names authoritative source (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
✓ Includes proper MLA citation
✓ Directly supports the claim about earnings

Explanation (Analysis):
"This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 annually. Over a forty-year career, this difference compounds to approximately $1.2 million in additional lifetime earnings for degree holders. Even accounting for four years of tuition costs and foregone income during college, graduates typically recover their investment within ten years and continue accumulating wealth advantages for the remaining three decades of their careers."

This explanation:
✓ Does the math for the reader ($600/week → $30,000/year → $1.2M lifetime)
✓ Addresses potential objection (tuition costs)
✓ Explains WHY the evidence matters (recovery time, long-term advantage)
✓ Does NOT just repeat the evidence—analyzes it

Link (Connection):
"This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that despite initial costs, college education delivers a powerful return on investment that direct workforce entry cannot match."

This link:
✓ Refers back to thesis concept (return on investment)
✓ Reinforces the paragraph's claim
✓ Could transition to next paragraph if needed

COMPLETE BODY PARAGRAPH 1 EXAMPLE (6 sentences):

"College graduates consistently earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those who enter the workforce directly after high school. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with a bachelor's degree earn a median weekly salary of $1,432, compared to $853 for those with only a high school diploma (Bureau of Labor Statistics). This gap of nearly $600 per week translates to over $30,000 in additional annual income. Over a forty-year career, college graduates can expect to earn approximately $1.2 million more than their peers who hold only high school diplomas. Even accounting for tuition costs and foregone income during the college years, research from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce shows that graduates typically recover their educational investment within a decade (Carnevale). This substantial and persistent earning advantage demonstrates that despite initial costs, college education delivers a return on investment that direct workforce entry cannot match."

✓ Exceeds 3 sentences (6 sentences)
✓ ONE claim (earnings advantage)
✓ Detailed examples (specific dollar amounts, timeframes)
✓ Fully developed (evidence + explanation + analysis)

BODY PARAGRAPH 2: CAREER FLEXIBILITY ARGUMENT

"Beyond financial benefits, college education provides unmatched career flexibility that becomes increasingly valuable in a rapidly changing economy. [TOPIC SENTENCE with transition] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that workers with bachelor's degrees have access to over 60% of job postings in the current market, compared to only 34% for those with high school diplomas alone (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [EVIDENCE with citation] This broader access matters because career paths rarely unfold as planned; the average American changes careers—not just jobs—five to seven times during their working life. [EXPLANATION] A college degree serves as a universal credential that opens doors across industries, while trade certifications, though valuable, typically qualify workers only for positions within their specific trade. [FURTHER EXPLANATION] For example, an electrician seeking to transition into project management, sales, or business ownership may find doors closed without additional credentials, whereas a college graduate can pivot between fields more readily. [DETAILED EXAMPLE] This flexibility provides not merely convenience but essential insurance against industry disruption, automation, and the unpredictable evolution of the job market. [LINK to thesis]"

✓ Exceeds 3 sentences (6 sentences)
✓ ONE claim (career flexibility)
✓ Effective transition from previous paragraph ("Beyond financial benefits")
✓ Detailed examples (percentages, career change statistics)
✓ Fully developed

BODY PARAGRAPH 3: COUNTERARGUMENT AND REBUTTAL

The rubric's "Distinguished" criteria mentions thorough development and support. A counterargument paragraph demonstrates sophisticated argumentation.

Structure for Counterargument Paragraph:
1. Acknowledge the opposing view fairly
2. Present their strongest point
3. Rebut with evidence
4. Reinforce why your position is stronger

"While proponents of trade schools and immediate employment raise valid points—including the ability to earn income immediately, avoid student debt, and learn practical skills—these advantages diminish significantly when examined over a full career span. [ACKNOWLEDGE opposition fairly] Trade school graduates do typically begin earning sooner, and many trades offer starting salaries that exceed entry-level positions available to new college graduates. [PRESENT their strongest point] However, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that by age 34, college graduates' earnings surpass those of trade workers, and this gap widens continuously through retirement (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). [REBUT with evidence] Additionally, trade work often involves physical demands that become increasingly difficult to sustain; Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that workers in physically demanding occupations report higher rates of chronic injury and earlier workforce exit than their office-based counterparts (Bureau of Labor Statistics). [ADDITIONAL evidence] These long-term realities—earnings crossover, physical toll, and career ceiling—reveal that the short-term advantages of skipping college come at the cost of long-term financial security and physical wellbeing. [LINK reinforcing thesis]"

✓ Exceeds 3 sentences (5 sentences)
✓ ONE claim (short-term trade advantages don't outweigh long-term college benefits)
✓ Addresses counterargument directly
✓ Detailed examples (age 34 crossover, injury rates)
✓ Rebuts with evidence, not just opinion

TRANSITION WORDS BETWEEN PARAGRAPHS:

The rubric requires "effective transitions." Each body paragraph should connect to the previous one.

Between Introduction and Body 1:
"The most compelling evidence for college's value lies in its financial returns."

Between Body 1 and Body 2:
"Beyond financial benefits..." / "In addition to earning power..." / "Financial advantages alone do not tell the complete story..."

Between Body 2 and Body 3 (Counterargument):
"While these advantages are substantial, critics of college education raise important objections..." / "Despite this evidence, proponents of alternative paths argue..."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3: ORGANIZATION (15 Points)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RUBRIC REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTINGUISHED (15/15):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • HIGHLY ORGANIZED structure                                                │
│ • CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE beginning, middle, and end sections                  │
│ • Ideas flow LOGICALLY                                                      │
│ • STRONG, EXPLICIT transitions SMOOTHLY connecting each segment             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SCORING BREAKDOWN:
Points | Requirements
-------|-------------
15     | Highly organized, clear beginning/middle/end, logical flow, strong explicit transitions
12     | Clear organization, appropriate transitions, mostly logical sequencing
9      | Basic structure, inconsistent transitions, occasional confusion
6      | Disorganized, weak/missing transitions, difficult to follow, abrupt endings
3      | No clear structure, absent transitions, scattered ideas, no cohesion

WHAT "HIGHLY ORGANIZED" MEANS:

Your essay must have:
1. Clear beginning (Introduction)
2. Clear middle (Three body paragraphs in logical order)
3. Clear end (Conclusion)

Each section must be IDENTIFIABLE—a reader should immediately know where they are in your argument.

LOGICAL FLOW OF IDEAS:

Your body paragraphs should follow a logical sequence. Options:

Option 1: Strongest to Weakest
- Lead with your most powerful argument
- Build credibility early, then reinforce

Option 2: Weakest to Strongest (Climactic)
- Build toward your most powerful argument
- End body section on highest note

Option 3: Problem-Solution-Rebuttal
- Para 1: Establish the problem/stakes
- Para 2: Present your solution's benefits
- Para 3: Address objections

Recommended for Your Essay:
1. Body ¶1: Financial argument (concrete, data-driven, foundational)
2. Body ¶2: Career flexibility (builds on financial with broader implications)
3. Body ¶3: Counterargument/rebuttal (sophisticated conclusion to argument)

This order works because:
- Money is tangible and attention-grabbing
- Flexibility expands the argument beyond just money
- Counterargument shows you've considered all angles

STRONG, EXPLICIT TRANSITIONS:

The rubric specifically requires "strong, explicit transitions smoothly connecting each segment."

EXPLICIT = stated clearly, not implied
SMOOTH = natural flow, not jarring

Between Introduction → Body 1:
Weak: "College has benefits."
Strong: "The most immediate and measurable advantage of college education appears in lifetime earnings data."

Between Body 1 → Body 2:
Weak: "Another point is flexibility."
Strong: "Beyond these financial advantages, college provides career flexibility that proves invaluable as industries evolve and job markets shift."

Between Body 2 → Body 3:
Weak: "Some people disagree."
Strong: "While these benefits are substantial, advocates for trade schools and immediate employment raise objections that deserve serious consideration."

Between Body 3 → Conclusion:
Weak: "In conclusion..."
Strong: "When weighing short-term convenience against long-term outcomes, the evidence consistently favors higher education."

PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE FOR ORGANIZATION:

Each paragraph should:
1. Begin with a clear topic sentence (tells reader what this paragraph proves)
2. Stay focused on ONE idea
3. End with a sentence that either:
   - Links back to the thesis, OR
   - Transitions to the next paragraph

COMMON ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS (lose points):

Problem 1: Jumping between ideas
"College graduates earn more money. Also, trade school involves physical labor. Universities have good networking opportunities. Some people prefer hands-on work."
→ No logical flow, reader is confused

Problem 2: Missing transitions
"[End of paragraph about earnings] Flexibility is another consideration."
→ Abrupt, no connection between ideas

Problem 3: No clear sections
Essay reads as one continuous stream without clear paragraph breaks or section purposes.

Problem 4: Conclusion introduces new arguments
This disrupts the "clear end" requirement—conclusions summarize, not introduce.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4: IN-TEXT CITATIONS (15 Points)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RUBRIC REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTINGUISHED (15/15):

"Workers with bachelor's degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432 (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

"College graduates experience lower unemployment rates across all economic conditions (Carnevale)."

Format 2: Signal Phrase (Integrated Citation)
Name the source in your sentence. No parenthetical citation needed if the source is clear.

"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with bachelor's degrees earn a median weekly salary of $1,432."

"Research by Anthony Carnevale at Georgetown University demonstrates that college graduates experience lower unemployment rates."

CITATION RULES:

Rule 1: Author Known
Use author's last name only.
"...demonstrates significant advantages (Smith)."

Rule 2: No Author (Organization as Author)
Use the organization name.
"...according to recent data (Bureau of Labor Statistics)."

CRITICAL DISTINCTION: DISTINGUISHED VS. PROFICIENT

Distinguished (15 points): "brings together ALL THE POINTS addressed in the essay"
Proficient (12 points): "reflection that reinforces the thesis" (but doesn't require all points)

To earn full points, your conclusion MUST reference all three body paragraph arguments, not just restate the thesis.

SENTENCE COUNT REQUIREMENT:
- "Exceeds 3 sentences" = AT LEAST 4 sentences
- Write 4-6 sentences to ensure full credit

THE FOUR COMPONENTS OF A DISTINGUISHED CONCLUSION:

Component 1: Restated Thesis (Different Words)
Do NOT copy your introduction thesis. Rephrase it to reflect what you've proven.

Introduction thesis:
"College education remains the strongest path for most high school graduates because it provides greater career flexibility, significantly higher lifetime earnings, and critical thinking skills essential for adapting to an evolving economy."

Restated thesis:
"The evidence demonstrates conclusively that for most students, pursuing a college degree represents the wisest investment in their professional futures."

Component 2: Summary of ALL Main Points
You must touch on ALL THREE body paragraph arguments:

"Higher lifetime earnings, broader career options, and the ability to adapt to economic changes all favor the college-educated worker."

This single sentence references:
✓ Body ¶1: earnings
✓ Body ¶2: career options/flexibility
✓ Body ¶3: adaptability (implied in counterargument rebuttal)

Component 3: Thoughtful/Reflective Element
Go beyond mere summary. Show deeper thinking about implications:

"While alternative paths may work for specific individuals with clear vocational goals, they rarely provide the breadth of opportunity that a college degree unlocks."

This adds reflection—acknowledging nuance while maintaining position.

Component 4: Final Thought (Memorable Closing)
End with something that resonates—a broader implication, call to action, or thought-provoking statement:

"High school seniors facing this crossroads should recognize that the four years invested in higher education are not a delay in beginning their careers—they are the foundation upon which lasting professional success is built."

WHAT "NO NEW DETAILS" MEANS:

Do NOT introduce in the conclusion:
✗ New evidence or statistics
✗ New arguments you haven't made
✗ New sources or citations
✗ New counterarguments

You CAN include:
✓ Broader implications of your proven arguments
✓ Call to action based on what you've established
✓ Reflection on the significance of your evidence
✓ Forward-looking statements about the topic's importance

EXAMPLE DISTINGUISHED CONCLUSION (5 sentences):

"The evidence demonstrates conclusively that for most students, pursuing a college degree represents the wisest investment in their professional futures. [RESTATED THESIS - different words] With substantially higher lifetime earnings, access to a broader range of career opportunities, and the flexibility to adapt as industries evolve, college graduates are positioned for long-term success in ways that trade school and immediate employment cannot replicate. [SUMMARY OF ALL POINTS - earnings, flexibility, adaptability] While alternative paths may suit individuals with specific vocational goals and circumstances, they rarely provide the same breadth of opportunity or financial security over a full career. [THOUGHTFUL REFLECTION - nuanced acknowledgment] The data on earnings, unemployment, and career mobility all point to the same conclusion: higher education pays dividends that compound over decades. [REINFORCEMENT without new evidence] High school seniors facing this decision should recognize that college is not merely a path to a first job—it is the foundation for a lifetime of professional growth and financial stability. [FINAL THOUGHT - memorable, forward-looking]"

✓ Exceeds 3 sentences (5 sentences)
✓ Thoughtful and reflective
✓ Reinforces thesis
✓ Brings together all points (earnings, flexibility, adaptability)
✓ No new details/evidence

COMMON CONCLUSION ERRORS (lose points):

Error 1: Introducing new arguments
"In conclusion, college also provides valuable social connections..."
→ If you didn't discuss this in the body, don't introduce it here.

Error 2: Only restating thesis without summarizing points
"College is the best choice for most students."
→ Doesn't bring together the specific arguments you made.

Error 3: Undermining your argument
"Of course, this is just my opinion and everyone should do what's best for them."
→ Weakens your entire essay. Stand by your argument.

Error 4: Starting with "In conclusion"
Not technically wrong, but overused and signals weak writing. Find a stronger opening.

Error 5: Being too brief
"College is better than trades. Students should go to college. The end."
→ Doesn't meet sentence requirement or provide reflection.

RUBRIC REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTINGUISHED (10/10):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ • NO ERRORS in spelling, punctuation, or grammar                            │
│ • VARIED SENTENCE STRUCTURES                                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SCORING BREAKDOWN:
Points | Requirements
-------|-------------
10     | No errors in spelling/punctuation/grammar, varied sentence structures
8      | Few minor errors, some sentence variety
6      | Noticeable errors slightly impacting readability, limited sentence variety
4      | Frequent errors significantly impacting readability, repetitive structures
2      | Numerous critical errors making comprehension difficult

SPELLING REQUIREMENTS:

Zero tolerance for spelling errors at the Distinguished level.

Strategies:
- Use spell-check, but don't rely on it exclusively
- Watch for commonly confused words spell-check misses:
  - their/there/they're
  - your/you're
  - its/it's
  - affect/effect
  - than/then
  - to/too/two
- Read your essay backward (last sentence first) to catch errors
- Have someone else proofread

PUNCTUATION REQUIREMENTS:

Comma Rules:
- After introductory phrases: "Despite the cost, college provides..."
- Before coordinating conjunctions in compound sentences: "College is expensive, but the investment pays off."
- Around non-essential information: "Trade schools, which offer hands-on training, appeal to some students."
- In lists: "College provides flexibility, higher earnings, and networking opportunities."

Semicolon Rules:
- Between independent clauses without a conjunction: "College graduates earn more; this advantage compounds over time."
- Before conjunctive adverbs: "Trade work pays well initially; however, earnings plateau."

Apostrophe Rules:
- Possessives: "The graduate's salary" / "The graduates' salaries"
- NOT in plurals: "College graduates" (not "graduate's")
- NOT in "its" (possessive): "The degree has its advantages"

Period Placement with Citations:
- Citation comes BEFORE the period: "...according to research (Smith)."
- NOT: "...according to research. (Smith)"

GRAMMAR REQUIREMENTS:

Subject-Verb Agreement:
✓ "The data show..." (data is plural)
✓ "The number of graduates is increasing..." (number is singular)
✗ "Each of the students have..." → "Each of the students has..."

Pronoun Agreement:
✓ "A student should complete their work..." (acceptable singular they)
✓ "Students should complete their work..."
✗ "A student should complete his work..." (gendered assumption)

Verb Tense Consistency:
Stay in present tense when discussing research and general facts:
✓ "Research shows that graduates earn more..."
✗ "Research showed that graduates earned more..." (past tense implies outdated)

Parallel Structure:
✓ "College provides higher earnings, greater flexibility, and broader skills."
✗ "College provides higher earnings, you get more flexibility, and skills are broader."

SENTENCE VARIETY REQUIREMENTS:

The rubric specifically requires "varied sentence structures." This means mixing:

1. Simple Sentences (one independent clause):
"College graduates earn more."

2. Compound Sentences (two independent clauses joined by conjunction):
"College requires initial investment, but the returns are substantial."

3. Complex Sentences (independent + dependent clause):
"Although trades offer immediate income, college provides superior long-term returns."

4. Compound-Complex Sentences (multiple clauses of both types):
"While some argue that trade school avoids debt, research shows that college graduates recover costs quickly, and they continue earning more throughout their careers."

VARIED SENTENCE EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH:

"College graduates consistently earn more over their lifetimes. [SIMPLE] According to federal data, the earnings gap exceeds $30,000 annually, and this difference compounds over a forty-year career. [COMPOUND] Although trade workers may earn more initially, college graduates surpass them by their mid-thirties. [COMPLEX] This crossover point matters significantly because workers typically have three decades of employment remaining, during which college graduates accumulate substantial additional wealth. [COMPLEX] The financial case for college is clear: short-term costs yield long-term gains. [SIMPLE with colon]"

This paragraph demonstrates:
✓ Simple sentences
✓ Compound sentences
✓ Complex sentences
✓ Varied sentence openings
✓ Different sentence lengths

REPETITIVE STRUCTURES (lose points):

Bad Example:
"College graduates earn more money. Trade workers earn less money. College provides more opportunities. Trade school provides fewer opportunities. College is the better choice. Trade school is not the better choice."

Problems:
- All simple sentences
- Same sentence pattern (Subject + verb + object)
- Same length sentences
- Same opening word pattern

FORMAL ACADEMIC TONE:

Avoid These (Informal)          | Use These (Formal)
-------------------------------|--------------------------------
Contractions (don't, can't)    | Full forms (do not, cannot)
First person (I think, I believe) | Third person (Evidence suggests, Research indicates)
Second person (you)            | Third person (students, graduates, workers)
Slang (a lot, kind of, really) | Precise (significantly, somewhat, considerably)
Vague words (things, stuff)    | Specific terms (factors, elements, considerations)
Questions                      | Statements
Exclamation points            | Periods

Examples:
✗ "I think college is definitely the best choice!"
✓ "Evidence strongly supports college as the optimal choice."

✗ "You can earn a lot more money with a degree."
✓ "Degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetimes."

✗ "College is really important because of job stuff."
✓ "College education proves essential for career advancement."

YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE:

You have trade experience. This is rare and valuable for this topic. Use it:

1. In your counterargument paragraph, you can acknowledge trade benefits with AUTHENTICITY:
   "Having worked in the trades, the appeal of immediate income and hands-on work is understandable..."

2. Your rebuttal carries more weight because you're not arguing from ignorance:
   "However, the physical toll and career ceiling become apparent over time..."

3. This personal stake makes your argument for college more compelling:
   "Despite these firsthand experiences with trade work's advantages, the evidence for college remains overwhelming..."

Note: Even with this personal connection, maintain formal academic tone. Don't overuse first person—one brief acknowledgment of your experience is sufficient and powerful.
